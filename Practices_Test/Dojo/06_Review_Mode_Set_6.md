## Câu 1 (Chọn 1 đáp án (Single Choice))
**Domain:** *CSAA – Design Secure Architectures*

### Đề bài (Question)
A company deployed a web application to an EC2 instance that adds a variety of photo effects to a picture uploaded by the users. The application will put the generated photos to an S3 bucket by sending PUT requests to the S3 API.

What is the best option for this scenario considering that you need to have API credentials to be able to send a request to the S3 API?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [x] **A.** Create a role in IAM. Afterwards, assign this role to a new EC2 instance.
- [ ] **B.** Store the API credentials in the root web application directory of the EC2 instance.
- [ ] **C.** Encrypt the API credentials and store in any directory of the EC2 instance.
- [ ] **D.** Store your API credentials in Amazon S3 Glacier.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **A**
> - **A.** Create a role in IAM. Afterwards, assign this role to a new EC2 instance.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
The best option is to create a role in IAM. Afterward, assign this role to a new EC2 instance. Applications must sign their API requests with AWS credentials. Therefore, if you are an application developer, you need a strategy for managing credentials for your applications that run on EC2 instances.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/AWS-IAMRole-Trust.png)

You can securely distribute your AWS credentials to the instances, enabling the applications on those instances to use your credentials to sign requests while protecting your credentials from other users. However, it’s challenging to securely distribute credentials to each instance, especially those that AWS creates on your behalf such as Spot Instances or instances in Auto Scaling groups. You must also be able to update the credentials on each instance when you rotate your AWS credentials.

In this scenario, you have to use IAM roles so that your applications can securely make API requests from your instances without requiring you to manage the security credentials that the applications use. Instead of creating and distributing your AWS credentials, you can delegate permission to make API requests using IAM roles.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Create a role in IAM. Afterwards, assign this role to a new EC2 instance.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Encrypt the API credentials and storing in any directory of the EC2 instance** and **Store the API credentials in the root web application directory of the EC2 instance** are incorrect. Though you can store and use the API credentials in the EC2 instance, it will be difficult to manage just as mentioned above. You have to use IAM Roles.

- The option that says: **Store your API credentials in Amazon S3 Glacier** is incorrect as Amazon S3 Glacier is used for data archives and not for managing API credentials.

## Câu 2 (Chọn 1 đáp án (Single Choice))
**Domain:** *CSAA – Design Resilient Architectures*

### Đề bài (Question)
A company developed a financial analytics web application hosted in a Docker container using MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, and Node.js) stack. You want to easily port that web application to AWS Cloud which can automatically handle all the tasks such as balancing load, auto-scaling, monitoring, and placing your containers across your cluster.

Which of the following services can be used to fulfill this requirement?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** AWS Compute Optimizer
- [x] **B.** AWS Elastic Beanstalk
- [ ] **C.** AWS CloudFormation
- [ ] **D.** Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **B**
> - **B.** AWS Elastic Beanstalk

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**AWS Elastic Beanstalk** supports the deployment of web applications from Docker containers. With Docker containers, you can define your own runtime environment. You can choose your own platform, programming language, and any application dependencies (such as package managers or tools), that aren’t supported by other platforms. Docker containers are self-contained and include all the configuration information and software your web application requires to run.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/elasticbeanstalk-env-multi-container.jpg)

By using Docker with Elastic Beanstalk, you have an infrastructure that automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring. You can manage your web application in an environment that supports the range of services that are integrated with Elastic Beanstalk, including but not limited to VPC, RDS, and IAM.

Hence, the correct answer is: **AWS Elastic Beanstalk.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- **Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS)** is incorrect. Although it also provides Service Auto Scaling, Service Load Balancing, and Monitoring with CloudWatch, these features are not ***automatically*** enabled by default unlike with Elastic Beanstalk. Take note that the scenario requires a service that will* * ***automatically*** * handle all the tasks such as balancing load, auto-scaling, monitoring, and placing your containers across your cluster. *You will have to manually configure these things if you wish to use ECS. With Elastic Beanstalk, you can manage your web application in an environment that supports the range of services easier.

- **AWS CloudFormation** is incorrect. While you can deploy the infrastructure for your application thru CloudFormation templates, *y*ou will be the one responsible for connecting the AWS resources needed to build your application environment. With ElasticBeanstalk, all you have to do is upload your code; ElasticBeanstalk will automatically set up the environment for your application.

- **AWS Compute Optimizer** is incorrect. Compute Optimizer simply analyzes your workload and recommends the optimal AWS resources needed to improve performance and reduce costs.

## Câu 3 (Chọn nhiều đáp án (Multiple Choice))
**Domain:** *CSAA – Design Secure Architectures*

### Đề bài (Question)
A company has several websites and hosts its infrastructure on the AWS Cloud. The mission-critical web applications are hosted on fleets of Amazon EC2 instances behind Application Load Balancers. The company uses AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) provided certificate on the ALBs to enable HTTPS access on its websites. The security team wants to get notified 30 days before the expiration of the SSL certificates.

Which of the following can the Solutions Architect implement to meet this request? (Select TWO.)

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [x] **A.** Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that will check AWS Health or ACM expiration events related to ACM certificates. Send an alert notification to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when a certificate is going to expire in 30 days.
- [x] **B.** Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule and schedule it to run every day to identify the expiring ACM certificates. Configure to rule to check the `DaysToExpiry` metric of all ACM certificates in Amazon CloudWatch. Send an alert notification to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when a certificate is going to expire in 30 days.
- [ ] **C.** Utilize AWS Trusted Advisor to check for the ACM certificates that will expire in 30 days. Using this metric, create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that will send an alert to an AWS Systems Manager OpsItem.
- [ ] **D.** Use AWS Config to manually create a rule that checks for certificate expiry on ACM. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule to send an alert to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when AWS Config flags a resource.
- [ ] **E.** Modify all certificates to use the AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that will check for ACM events that shows certificates expiring within 30 days. Set the target to invoke an AWS Lambda function to send a message to an Amazon SNS topic.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **A, B**
> - **A.** Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that will check AWS Health or ACM expiration events related to ACM certificates. Send an alert notification to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when a certificate is going to expire in 30 days.
> - **B.** Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule and schedule it to run every day to identify the expiring ACM certificates. Configure to rule to check the `DaysToExpiry` metric of all ACM certificates in Amazon CloudWatch. Send an alert notification to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when a certificate is going to expire in 30 days.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**Amazon EventBridge** is a serverless event bus service that connects application components using events. It enables you to detect changes in your AWS environment (such as ACM certificate expiration) and respond with automated actions. EventBridge integrates seamlessly with other AWS services like ACM, AWS Health, and Amazon SNS to trigger notifications or workflows based on predefined conditions.

![example eventbridge rule for ACM](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/td-example-eventbridge-rule-for-acm-01-08-25.png)

 **Amazon CloudWatch** is a monitoring service for AWS resources that allows you to collect and track metrics, set alarms, and automate responses to changes in your AWS environment. It monitors resource performance by collecting and tracking metrics, logs, and events. One of the features of CloudWatch is the `DaysToExpiry` metric for AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) certificates, which indicates the number of days remaining until a certificate expires.

![DaysToExpiry metric in CloudWatch Alarm](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/td-daystoexpiry-metric-01-08-25.png)

 **AWS Health** events are generated for ACM certificates that are eligible for renewal. Health events are generated in two scenarios:

-On successful renewal of a public or private certificate.

-When a customer must take action for a renewal to occur. This may mean clicking a link in an email message (for email-validated certificates), or resolving an error. One of the following event codes is included with each event. The codes are exposed as variables that you can use for filtering.

-AWS_ACM_RENEWAL_STATE_CHANGE (the certificate has been renewed, has expired, or is due to expire)

-CAA_CHECK_FAILURE (CAA check failed)

-AWS_ACM_RENEWAL_FAILURE (for certificates signed by a private CA)

ACM sends daily expiration events for all active certificates (public, private and imported) starting 45 days prior to expiration. You can use expiration events to set up automation to reimport certificates into ACM. You can create CloudWatch rules based on these events and use the CloudWatch console to configure actions that take place when the events are detected.

For this scenario, you can have two possible options to implement. The first option uses an AWS ACM built-in Certificate Expiration event, which is raised through Amazon EventBridge, to invoke a Lambda function. In this option, the function is configured to publish the result as a finding in Security Hub, and also as an SNS topic used for email subscriptions. As a result, an administrator can be notified of a specific expiring certificate, or an IT service management (ITSM) system can automatically open a case or incident through email or SNS.

The second option uses the ` **DaysToExpiry** ` metric to schedule a batch search of expiring certificates and to log all the findings. The metric also provides a single SNS notification for all expiring certificates.

Therefore, the correct answers are:

 **– Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that will check AWS Health or ACM expiration events related to ACM certificates. Send an alert notification to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when a certificate is going to expire in 30 days**

 **– Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule and schedule it to run every day to identify the expiring ACM certificates. Configure to rule to check the `DaysToExpiry` metric of all ACM certificates in Amazon CloudWatch. Send an alert notification to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when a certificate is going to expire in 30 days.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Use AWS Config to manually create a rule that checks for certificate expiry on ACM. Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule to send an alert to an Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) topic when AWS Config flags a resource** is incorrect. AWS Certificate Manager automatically generates AWS Health events. Manually creating a custom AWS Config rule to check for SSL expiry is unnecessary. In addition, AWS Config already provides a built-in acm-certificate-expiration-check managed rule that you can use.

- The option that says: **Modify all certificates to use the AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority. ** **Create an Amazon EventBridge (Amazon CloudWatch Events) rule that will check for ACM events that shows certificates expiring within 30 days. Set the target to invoke an AWS Lambda function to send a message to an Amazon SNS topic** is incorrect. There’s absolutely no need to modify all the existing SSL certificates to use the AWS Certificate Manager Private Certificate Authority. This feature simply provides you a highly-available private CA service without the upfront investment and ongoing maintenance costs of operating your own private CA.

- The option that says: **Utilize AWS Trusted Advisor to check for the ACM certificates that will expire in 30 days. Using this metric, create an Amazon CloudWatch alarm that will send an alert to an AWS Systems Manager OpsItem** is incorrect. A Systems Manager OpsItem is simply a feature of the AWS Systems Manager OpsCenter service. This is just is an operational work item that provides data to the OpsItem widgets of Amazon Systems Manager Explorer. In addition, the AWS Trusted Advisor checks do not include expiring SSL certificates in AWS Certificate Manager.

## Câu 4 (Chọn 1 đáp án (Single Choice))
**Domain:** *CSAA – Design Secure Architectures*

### Đề bài (Question)
A company has several unencrypted Amazon EBS snapshots in its Amazon VPC. The Solutions Architect must ensure that all of the new EBS volumes restored from the unencrypted snapshots are automatically encrypted.

What should be done to accomplish this requirement?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [x] **A.** Enable the EBS Encryption By Default feature for the AWS Region.
- [ ] **B.** Enable the EBS Encryption By Default feature for specific EBS volumes.
- [ ] **C.** Launch new EBS volumes and specify the symmetric encryption AWS KMS keys for encryption.
- [ ] **D.** Launch new EBS volumes and encrypt them using asymmetric AWS KMS keys.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **A**
> - **A.** Enable the EBS Encryption By Default feature for the AWS Region.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
You can configure your AWS account to enforce the encryption of the new EBS volumes and snapshot copies that you create. For example, Amazon EBS encrypts the EBS volumes created when you launch an instance and the snapshots that you copy from an unencrypted snapshot.

![EBS encryption](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/EBS_Encryption_By_Default.png)

Encryption by default has no effect on existing EBS volumes or snapshots. The following are important considerations in EBS encryption:

 **– Encryption by default** is a Region-specific setting. If you enable it for a Region, you cannot disable it for individual volumes or snapshots in that Region.

– When you enable encryption by default, you can launch an instance only if the instance type supports EBS encryption.

– Amazon EBS does not support asymmetric KMS keys.

You cannot change the KMS keys that is associated with an existing snapshot or encrypted volume. However, you can associate a different KMS keys during a snapshot copy operation so that the resulting copied snapshot is encrypted by the new KMS keys.

Although there is no direct way to encrypt an existing unencrypted volume or snapshot, you can encrypt them by creating either a volume or a snapshot. If you enabled encryption by default, Amazon EBS encrypts the resulting new volume or snapshot using your default key for EBS encryption. Even if you have not enabled encryption by default, you can enable encryption when you create an individual volume or snapshot. Whether you enable encryption by default or in individual creation operations, you can override the default key for EBS encryption and use symmetric encryption KMS keys.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Enable the EBS Encryption By Default feature for the AWS Region.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Launch new EBS volumes and encrypt them using asymmetric AWS KMS keys** is incorrect because Amazon EBS does not primarily support asymmetric KMS keys. To encrypt an EBS snapshot, you need to use symmetric encryption KMS keys.

- The option that says: **Launch new EBS volumes and specify the symmetric encryption AWS KMS keys for encryption** is incorrect. Although this solution will enable data encryption, this process is manual and can potentially cause some unencrypted EBS volumes to be launched. A better solution is to enable the EBS Encryption By Default feature. It is stated in the scenario that all of the new EBS volumes restored from the unencrypted snapshots must be automatically encrypted.

- The option that says: **Enable the EBS Encryption By Default feature for specific EBS volumes** is incorrect because the Encryption By Default feature is a Region-specific setting and thus, you can’t enable it to selected EBS volumes only.

### Đề bài (Question)
A game development company operates several virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) games that use various RESTful web APIs hosted in its on-premises data center, which currently sits behind a content delivery network (CDN) for faster global delivery. Due to the unprecedented growth of the company, the management decided to migrate its system to AWS Cloud to scale out its resources as well as to minimize costs.

Which of the following is the most cost-effective and scalable solution to meet the above requirement?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Use a Spot Fleet of Amazon EC2 instances, each with an Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) for more consistent latency and higher network throughput. Set up an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic to the instances.
- [ ] **B.** Set up a micro-service architecture with Amazon ECS, Amazon ECR, and AWS Fargate.
- [x] **C.** Use AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway.
- [ ] **D.** Host the APIs in a static Amazon S3 web hosting bucket behind a Amazon CloudFront web distribution.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **C**
> - **C.** Use AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
With **AWS Lambda** , you pay only for what you use. You are charged based on the number of requests for your functions and the duration, the time it takes for your code to execute.

Lambda counts a request each time it starts executing in response to an event notification or invoke call, including test invokes from the console. You are charged for the total number of requests across all your functions.

Duration is calculated from the time your code begins executing until it returns or otherwise terminates, rounded up to the nearest 1ms. The price depends on the amount of memory you allocate to your function. The Lambda free tier includes 1M free requests per month and over 400,000 GB seconds of compute time per month.

![Serverless Web app](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/Serverlesswebapp-27March2026.png)

The best possible answer here is to use a combination of AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway because this solution is both scalable and cost-effective. You will only be charged when you use your Lambda function, unlike having an EC2 instance that always runs even though you don’t use it.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Use AWS Lambda and Amazon API Gateway.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Set up a micro-service architecture with Amazon ECS, Amazon ECR, and AWS Fargate** is incorrect because ECS is mainly used to host Docker applications, and in addition, using ECS, ECR, and Fargate alone is not scalable and not recommended for this type of scenario.

- The option that says: **Host the APIs in a static Amazon S3 web hosting bucket behind a Amazon CloudFront web distribution** is incorrect because it is not a suitable option as there is no compute capability for S3 and you can only use it as a static website. Although this solution is scalable since it uses CloudFront, the use of S3 to host the web APIs or the dynamic website is still incorrect.

- The option that says: **Use a Spot Fleet of Amazon EC2 instances, each with an Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) for more consistent latency and higher network throughput. Set up an Application Load Balancer to distribute traffic to the instances** is incorrect. EC2 alone, without Auto Scaling, is not scalable. Even though you use a Spot EC2 instance, it is still more expensive compared to Lambda because you will be charged only when your function is being used. An Elastic Fabric Adapter (EFA) is simply a network device that you can attach to your Amazon EC2 instance that enables you to achieve the application performance of an on-premises HPC cluster, with scalability, flexibility, and elasticity provided by the AWS Cloud. Although EFA is scalable, the Spot Fleet configuration of this option doesn’t have Auto Scaling involved.

### Đề bài (Question)
A company has a fleet of running Spot EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer. The incoming traffic comes from various users across multiple AWS regions, and you would like to have the user’s session shared among the fleet of instances.

A Solutions Architect is required to set up a distributed session management layer that will provide scalable and shared data storage for the user sessions that supports multithreaded performance. The cache layer must also detect any node failures and replace the failed ones automatically.

Which of the following would be the best choice to meet the requirement while still providing sub-millisecond latency for the users?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Amazon ElastiCache for Redis Global Datastore
- [ ] **B.** AWS ELB sticky sessions
- [ ] **C.** Amazon RDS database with RDS Proxy
- [x] **D.** Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached with Auto Discovery

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **D**
> - **D.** Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached with Auto Discovery

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
For sub-millisecond latency caching, **ElastiCache** is the best choice. In order to address scalability and to provide a shared data storage for sessions that can be accessed from any individual web server, you can abstract the HTTP sessions from the web servers themselves. A common solution for this is to leverage an In-Memory Key/Value store such as Redis and Memcached.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/caching-session-management-diagram-v2.c6856e6de83c4222dbc4853d9ff873f5542a86d8.png)

For clusters running the Memcached engine, ElastiCache supports Auto Discovery—the ability for client programs to automatically identify all of the nodes in a cache cluster, and to initiate and maintain connections to all of these nodes.

With Auto Discovery, your application does not need to manually connect to individual cache nodes; instead, your application connects to one Memcached node and retrieves the list of nodes. From that list, your application is aware of the rest of the nodes in the cluster and can connect to any of them. You do not need to hardcode the individual cache node endpoints in your application.

Cache node failures are automatically detected; failed nodes are automatically replaced.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Amazon ElastiCache for Memcached with Auto Discovery**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **ELB sticky sessions** is incorrect because the scenario does not require you to route a user to the particular web server that is managing that individual user’s session. Since the session state is shared among the instances, the use of the ELB sticky sessions feature is not recommended in this scenario.

- The option that says: **Amazon ElastiCache for Redis Global Datastore** is incorrect because Redis does not supports multithreaded performance by default. This cache layer is not capable of detecting any node failures and replacing the failed ones automatically. Keep in mind that the Global Datastore feature just allows your application to write to your ElastiCache for Redis cluster in one region and have the data available to be read from two other cross-region replica clusters, thereby enabling disaster recovery across regions.

- The option that says: **Amazon RDS Multi-AZ database instance with RDS Proxy** is incorrect. Although you can use RDS for storing session state, it is not the best choice in terms of cost-effectiveness and performance when compared to ElastiCache. There is a significant difference in terms of latency if you use RDS when you store the session data.

### Đề bài (Question)
A game company has a requirement of load balancing the incoming TCP traffic at the transport level (Layer 4) to their containerized gaming servers hosted in AWS Fargate. To maintain performance, it should handle millions of requests per second sent by gamers around the globe while maintaining ultra-low latencies.

Which of the following must be implemented in the current architecture to satisfy the new requirement?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Launch a new Application Load Balancer.
- [x] **B.** Launch a new Network Load Balancer.
- [ ] **C.** Launch a new microservice in AWS Fargate that acts as a load balancer since using an ALB or NLB with Fargate is not possible.
- [ ] **D.** Create a new record in Amazon Route 53 with Weighted Routing policy to load balance the incoming traffic.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **B**
> - **B.** Launch a new Network Load Balancer.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
Elastic Load Balancing automatically distributes incoming application traffic across multiple targets, such as Amazon EC2 instances, containers, IP addresses, and Lambda functions. It can handle the varying load of your application traffic in a single Availability Zone or across multiple Availability Zones. Elastic Load Balancing offers three types of load balancers that all feature the high availability, automatic scaling, and robust security necessary to make your applications fault-tolerant. They are: Application Load Balancer, Network Load Balancer, and Classic Load Balancer

 **Network Load Balancer** is best suited for load balancing of TCP traffic where extreme performance is required. Operating at the connection level (Layer 4), Network Load Balancer routes traffic to targets within Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) and is capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies. Network Load Balancer is also optimized to handle sudden and volatile traffic patterns.

- The option that says: **Launch a new Application Load Balancer** is incorrect because it cannot handle TCP or Layer 4 connections, only Layer 7 (HTTP and HTTPS).

- The option that says: ** Create a new record in Amazon Route 53 with Weighted Routing policy to load balance the incoming traffic** is incorrect. Although Route 53 can act as a load balancer by assigning each record a relative weight that corresponds to how much traffic you want to send to each resource, it is still not capable of handling millions of requests per second while maintaining ultra-low latencies. You have to use a Network Load Balancer instead.

- The option that says: **Launch a new microservice in AWS Fargate that acts as a load balancer since using an ALB or NLB with Fargate is not possible** is incorrect because you can place an ALB and NLB in front of your AWS Fargate cluster.

### Đề bài (Question)
A company requires corporate IT governance and cost oversight of all of its AWS resources across its divisions around the world. Their corporate divisions want to maintain administrative control of the discrete AWS resources they consume and ensure that those resources are separate from other divisions.

Which of the following options will support the autonomy of each corporate division while enabling the corporate IT to maintain governance and cost oversight? (Select TWO.)

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [x] **A.** Enable IAM cross-account access for all corporate IT administrators in each child account.
- [ ] **B.** Create separate Availability Zones for each division within the corporate IT AWS account. Improve communication between the two AZs using the AWS Global Accelerator.
- [ ] **C.** Use AWS Trusted Advisor and AWS Resource Groups Tag Editor
- [ ] **D.** Create separate VPCs for each division within the corporate IT AWS account. Launch an AWS Transit Gateway with equal-cost multipath routing (ECMP) and VPN tunnels for intra-VPC communication.
- [x] **E.** Use AWS Consolidated Billing by creating AWS Organizations to link the divisions’ accounts to a parent corporate account.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **A, E**
> - **A.** Enable IAM cross-account access for all corporate IT administrators in each child account.
> - **E.** Use AWS Consolidated Billing by creating AWS Organizations to link the divisions’ accounts to a parent corporate account.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
You can use an IAM role to delegate access to resources that are in different AWS accounts that you own. You share resources in one account with users in a different account. By setting up cross-account access in this way, you don’t need to create individual IAM users in each account. In addition, users don’t have to sign out of one account and sign into another in order to access resources that are in different AWS accounts.

![https://media.tutorialsdojo.com/aws-organizations-diagram-saa-c02.png](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/aws-organizations-diagram-saa-c02.png)

You can use the consolidated billing feature in AWS Organizations to consolidate payment for multiple AWS accounts or multiple AISPL accounts. With consolidated billing, you can see a combined view of AWS charges incurred by all of your accounts. You can also get a cost report for each member account that is associated with your master account. Consolidated billing is offered at no additional charge. AWS and AISPL accounts can’t be consolidated together.

The combined use of IAM and Consolidated Billing will support the autonomy of each corporate division while enabling corporate IT to maintain governance and cost oversight. Hence, the correct choices are:

 **– Enable IAM cross-account access for all corporate IT administrators in each child account**

 **– Use AWS Consolidated Billing by creating AWS Organizations to link the divisions’ accounts to a parent corporate account**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- **Using AWS Trusted Advisor and AWS Resource Groups Tag Editor** is incorrect. Trusted Advisor is an online tool that provides you real-time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices. It only provides you alerts on areas where you do not adhere to best practices and tells you how to improve them. It does not assist in maintaining governance over your AWS accounts. Additionally, the AWS Resource Groups Tag Editor simply allows you to add, edit, and delete tags to multiple AWS resources at once for easier identification and monitoring.

- **Creating separate VPCs for each division within the corporate IT AWS account. Launch an AWS Transit Gateway with equal-cost multipath routing (ECMP) and VPN tunnels for intra-VPC communication** is incorrect because creating separate VPCs would not separate the divisions from each other since they will still be operating under the same account and therefore contribute to the same billing each month. AWS Transit Gateway connects VPCs and on-premises networks through a central hub and acts as a cloud router where each new connection is only made once. For this particular scenario, it is suitable to use AWS Organizations instead of setting up an AWS Transit Gateway since the objective is for maintaining administrative control of the AWS resources and not for network connectivity.

- **Creating separate Availability Zones for each division within the corporate IT AWS account. Improve communication between the two AZs using the AWS Global Accelerator** is incorrect because you do not need to create Availability Zones. They are already provided for you by AWS right from the start, and not all services support multiple AZ deployments. In addition, having separate Availability Zones in your VPC does not meet the requirement of supporting the autonomy of each corporate division. The AWS Global Accelerator is a service that uses the AWS global network to optimize the network path from your users to your applications and not between your Availability Zones.

### Đề bài (Question)
A Solutions Architect is managing a three-tier web application that processes credit card payments and online transactions. Static web pages are used on the front-end tier while the application tier contains a single Amazon EC2 instance that handles long-running processes. The data is stored in a MySQL database. The Solutions Architect is instructed to decouple the tiers to create a highly available application.

Which of the following options can satisfy the given requirement?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Move all the static assets and web pages to Amazon CloudFront. Use Auto Scaling in Amazon EC2 instance. Migrate the database to Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ deployments configuration.
- [x] **B.** Move all the static assets and web pages to Amazon S3. Re-host the application to Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) containers and enable Service Auto Scaling. Migrate the database to Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ deployments configuration.
- [ ] **C.** Move all the static assets to Amazon S3. Set concurrency limit in AWS Lambda to move the application to a serverless architecture. Migrate the database to Amazon DynamoDB.
- [ ] **D.** Move all the static assets, web pages, and the backend application to a larger instance. Use Auto Scaling in Amazon EC2 instance. Migrate the database to Amazon Aurora.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **B**
> - **B.** Move all the static assets and web pages to Amazon S3. Re-host the application to Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) containers and enable Service Auto Scaling. Migrate the database to Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ deployments configuration.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)** is a highly scalable, high performance container management service that supports Docker containers and allows you to easily run applications on a managed cluster of Amazon EC2 instances. Amazon ECS makes it easy to use containers as a building block for your applications by eliminating the need for you to install, operate, and scale your own cluster management infrastructure. Amazon ECS lets you schedule long-running applications, services, and batch processes using Docker containers. Amazon ECS maintains application availability and allows you to scale your containers up or down to meet your application’s capacity requirements.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/product-page-diagram_ECS_1.86ebd8c223ec8b55aa1903c423fbe4e672f3daf7.png)

The requirement in the scenario is to decouple the services to achieve a highly available architecture. To accomplish this requirement, you must move the existing setup to each AWS services. For static assets, you should use Amazon S3. You can use Amazon ECS for your web application and then migrate the database to Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ deployment. Decoupling your app with application integration services allows them to remain interoperable, but if one service has a failure or spike in workload, it won’t affect the rest of them.

Hence, the correct answer is: ** Move all the static assets and web pages to Amazon S3. Re-host the application to Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) containers and enable Service Auto Scaling. Migrate the database to Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ deployments configuration.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Move all the static assets to Amazon S3. Set concurrency limit in AWS Lambda to move the application to a serverless architecture. Migrate the database to Amazon DynamoDB** is incorrect because Lambda functions can’t process long-running processes. Take note that a Lambda function has a maximum processing time of 15 minutes.

- The option that says: **Move all the static assets, web pages, and the backend application to a larger instance. Use Auto Scaling in Amazon EC2 instance. Migrate the database to Amazon Aurora** is incorrect because static assets are more suitable and cost-effective to be stored in S3 instead of storing them in an EC2 instance.

- The option that says: **Move all the static assets and web pages to Amazon CloudFront. Use Auto Scaling in Amazon EC2 instance. Migrate the database to Amazon RDS with Multi-AZ deployments configuration** is incorrect because you can’t store data in Amazon CloudFront. Technically, you only store cache data in CloudFront, but you can’t host applications or web pages using this service. You have to use Amazon S3 to host the static web pages and use CloudFront as the CDN.

### Đề bài (Question)
An online shopping platform has been deployed to AWS using Elastic Beanstalk. They simply uploaded their Node.js application, and Elastic Beanstalk automatically handles the details of capacity provisioning, load balancing, scaling, and application health monitoring. Since the entire deployment process is automated, the DevOps team is not sure where to get the application log files of their shopping platform.

In Elastic Beanstalk, where does it store the application files and server log files?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Application files are stored in S3. The server log files can be optionally stored in CloudTrail or in CloudWatch Logs.
- [ ] **B.** Application files are stored in S3. The server log files can only be stored in the attached EBS volumes of the EC2 instances, which were launched by AWS Elastic Beanstalk.
- [x] **C.** Application files are stored in S3. The server log files can also optionally be stored in S3 or in CloudWatch Logs.
- [ ] **D.** Application files are stored in S3. The server log files can be stored directly in Glacier or in CloudWatch Logs.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **C**
> - **C.** Application files are stored in S3. The server log files can also optionally be stored in S3 or in CloudWatch Logs.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**AWS Elastic Beanstalk** stores your application files and optionally, server log files in Amazon S3. If you are using the AWS Management Console, the AWS Toolkit for Visual Studio, or AWS Toolkit for Eclipse, an Amazon S3 bucket will be created in your account and the files you upload will be automatically copied from your local client to Amazon S3. Optionally, you may configure Elastic Beanstalk to copy your server log files every hour to Amazon S3. You do this by editing the environment configuration settings.

Thus, the correct answer is the option that says: **Application files are stored in S3. The server log files can also optionally be stored in S3 or in CloudWatch Logs.**

With **CloudWatch Logs** , you can monitor and archive your Elastic Beanstalk application, system, and custom log files from Amazon EC2 instances of your environments. You can also configure alarms that make it easier for you to react to specific log stream events that your metric filters extract. The CloudWatch Logs agent installed on each Amazon EC2 instance in your environment publishes metric data points to the CloudWatch service for each log group you configure. Each log group applies its own filter patterns to determine what log stream events to send to CloudWatch as data points. Log streams that belong to the same log group share the same retention, monitoring, and access control settings. You can configure Elastic Beanstalk to automatically stream logs to the CloudWatch service.

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Application files are stored in S3. The server log files can only be stored in the attached EBS volumes of the EC2 instances, which were launched by AWS Elastic Beanstalk** is incorrect because the server log files can also be stored in either S3 or CloudWatch Logs, and not only on the EBS volumes of the EC2 instances which are launched by AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

- The option that says: **Application files are stored in S3. The server log files can be stored directly in Glacier or in CloudWatch Logs** is incorrect because the server log files can optionally be stored in either S3 or CloudWatch Logs, but not directly to Glacier. You can create a lifecycle policy to the S3 bucket to store the server logs and archive it in Glacier, but there is no direct way of storing the server logs to Glacier using Elastic Beanstalk unless you do it programmatically.

- The option that says: **Application files are stored in S3. The server log files can be optionally stored in CloudTrail or in CloudWatch Logs** is incorrect because the server log files can optionally be stored in either S3 or CloudWatch Logs, but not directly to CloudTrail as this service is primarily used for auditing API calls.

### Đề bài (Question)
An e-commerce company plans to optimize its disaster recovery configuration using AWS Cloud to minimize operational disruptions during outages or major system maintenance for its on-premises Microsoft SQL Server-based application. The objective is to achieve a recovery point objective (RPO) of 60 seconds or less and a recovery time objective (RTO) of 1 hour.

Which of the following is the MOST cost-effective solution for this scenario?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [x] **A.** Set up a pilot light strategy using AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS) to replicate the changes of the on-premises application to AWS
- [ ] **B.** On AWS, implement a warm standby using Amazon RDS for SQL Server database and configure AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) with change data capture (CDC) to sync the data from the on-premises application.
- [ ] **C.** Back up SQL Server to AWS Storage Gateway for hybrid storage and fast disaster recovery. Enable fast snapshot restore in Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS).
- [ ] **D.** Use Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise with Always On availability groups and set up a multi-site active/active setup between the corporate on-premises application and AWS.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **A**
> - **A.** Set up a pilot light strategy using AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS) to replicate the changes of the on-premises application to AWS

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS)** provides continuous block-level replication, recovery orchestration, and automated server conversion capabilities. These allow customers to achieve a crash-consistent recovery point objective (RPO) of seconds, and a recovery time objective (RTO) typically ranging between 5–20 minutes.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/aws-elastic-disaster-recovery_17jul2023.png)

In the event of a disaster, AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS) assists in performing a failover to AWS for immediate recovery. After mitigating the disaster, a failback to the original source infrastructure is necessary. AWS DRS facilitates preparedness through easy drill launches and frequent testing of instances. During a failover, recovery instances are launched in AWS based on a selected snapshot. To complete the failback, the AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery Failback Client is installed on the target server, and specific credentials are generated. Cross-Region or cross-AZ failover and failback can be executed directly from the AWS DRS Console. For vCenter, AWS DRS offers scalable failback with the DRS Mass Failback Automation client (DRSFA client). Once the failback is finished, the recovery instance can be terminated, deleted, or disconnected.

To establish a secure data replication process, configure AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery on your source servers. This setup involves replicating your data to a dedicated subnet within your AWS account located in the AWS Region of your choice. By utilizing a staging area design, this approach optimizes cost-efficiency by leveraging cost-effective storage and minimal compute resources for continuous replication maintenance.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Set up a pilot light strategy using AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS) to replicate the changes of the on-premises application to AWS**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Use Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise with Always On availability groups and set up a multi-site active/active setup between the corporate on-premises application and AWS** is incorrect. Although using the “SQL Server Always On availability groups” feature can meet the required RTO and RPO, this approach entails high costs. Take note that the scenario explicitly mentioned that the cost of the disaster recovery solution should be low. This particular setup requires multiple replication servers to run, and thus, the operating cost is high. In this situation, a more cost-effective solution is to use the AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS) service.

- The option that says: **Back up SQL Server to AWS Storage Gateway for hybrid storage and fast disaster recovery. Enable fast snapshot restore in Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) ** is incorrect. AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid storage solution that provides off-site backup capabilities. However, it may not be the most efficient solution for disaster recovery of an e-commerce company’s SQL Server-based application. It lacks automated failover capabilities and may require manual intervention to restore data in case of a failure.

- The option that says: **On AWS, implement a warm standby using Amazon RDS for SQL Server database and configure AWS Database Migration Service (AWS DMS) with change data capture (CDC) to sync the data from the on-premises application** is incorrect. Using the warm standby strategy actually meets the required RTO and RPO of the application; however, this is accompanied by a high cost since you have to maintain a running Amazon RDS for SQL database. A more cost-effective solution would be to use the AWS Elastic Disaster Recovery (AWS DRS) service which also offers excellent RTO and RPO.

### Đề bài (Question)
A Solutions Architect designed a real-time data analytics system based on Kinesis Data Stream and Lambda. A week after the system has been deployed, the users noticed that it performed slowly as the data rate increases. The Architect identified that the performance of the Kinesis Data Streams is causing this problem.

Which of the following should the Architect do to improve performance?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Replace the data stream with Amazon Data Firehose instead.
- [ ] **B.** Implement Step Scaling to the Kinesis Data Stream.
- [ ] **C.** Improve the performance of the stream by decreasing the number of its shards using the `MergeShard` command.
- [x] **D.** Increase the number of shards of the Kinesis stream by using the `UpdateShardCount` command.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **D**
> - **D.** Increase the number of shards of the Kinesis stream by using the `UpdateShardCount` command.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
Amazon Kinesis Data Streams supports *resharding*, which lets you adjust the number of shards in your stream to adapt to changes in the rate of data flow through the stream. Resharding is considered an advanced operation.

There are two types of resharding operations: shard split and shard merge. In a shard split, you divide a single shard into two shards. In a shard merge, you combine two shards into a single shard. Resharding is always *pairwise* in the sense that you cannot split into more than two shards in a single operation, and you cannot merge more than two shards in a single operation. The shard or pair of shards that the resharding operation acts on are referred to as *parent* shards. The shard or pair of shards that result from the resharding operation are referred to as *child *shards.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/Markus Python image 1.png)

Splitting increases the number of shards in your stream and therefore increases the data capacity of the stream. Because you are charged on a per-shard basis, splitting increases the cost of your stream. Similarly, merging reduces the number of shards in your stream and therefore decreases the data capacity—and cost—of the stream.

If your data rate increases, you can also increase the number of shards allocated to your stream to maintain the application performance. You can reshard your stream using the **UpdateShardCount** API. The throughput of an Amazon Kinesis data stream is designed to scale without limits via increasing the number of shards within a data stream.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Increase the number of shards of the Kinesis stream by using the `UpdateShardCount` command** .

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Replacing the data stream with Amazon Data Firehose instead** is incorrect because the throughput of Data Firehose is not exceptionally higher than Kinesis Data Streams. In fact, the throughput of an Amazon Kinesis data stream is designed to scale **without** limits via increasing the number of shards within a data stream.

- The option that says: **Improving the performance of the stream by decreasing the number of its shards using the `MergeShard` command** is incorrect because merging the shards will effectively decrease the performance of the stream rather than improve it.

- The option that says: **Implementing Step Scaling to the Kinesis Data Stream** is incorrect because there is no Step Scaling feature for Kinesis Data Streams. This is only applicable for EC2.

### Đề bài (Question)
A Solutions Architect is working for a weather station in Asia with a weather monitoring system that needs to be migrated to AWS. Since the monitoring system requires a low network latency and high network throughput, the Architect decided to launch the EC2 instances to a new cluster placement group. The system was working fine for a couple of weeks, however, when they try to add new instances to the placement group that already has running EC2 instances, they receive an ‘insufficient capacity error’.

How will the Architect fix this issue?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Submit a capacity increase request to AWS as you are initially limited to only 12 instances per Placement Group.
- [ ] **B.** Create another Placement Group and launch the new instances in the new group.
- [x] **C.** Stop and restart the instances in the Placement Group and then try the launch again.
- [ ] **D.** Verify all running instances are of the same size and type and then try the launch again.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **C**
> - **C.** Stop and restart the instances in the Placement Group and then try the launch again.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
A cluster placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availability Zone. A cluster placement group can span peered VPCs in the same Region. Instances in the same cluster placement group enjoy a higher per-flow throughput limit for TCP/IP traffic and are placed in the same high-bisection bandwidth segment of the network.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/ec2-cluster-placement-group.jpg)

It is recommended that you launch the number of instances that you need in the placement group in a single launch request and that you use the same instance type for all instances in the placement group. If you try to add more instances to the placement group later, or if you try to launch more than one instance type in the placement group, you increase your chances of getting an insufficient capacity error. If you stop an instance in a placement group and then start it again, it still runs in the placement group. However, the start fails if there isn’t enough capacity for the instance.

If you receive a capacity error when launching an instance in a placement group that already has running instances, stop and start all of the instances in the placement group, and try the launch again. Restarting the instances may migrate them to hardware that has capacity for all the requested instances.

Stop and restart the instances in the Placement group and then try the launch again can resolve this issue. If the instances are stopped and restarted, AWS may move the instances to a hardware that has the capacity for all the requested instances.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Stop and restart the instances in the Placement Group and then try the launch again.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Create another Placement Group and launch the new instances in the new group** is incorrect because to benefit from the enhanced networking, all the instances should be in the same Placement Group. Launching the new ones in a new Placement Group will not work in this case.

- The option that says: **Verify all running instances are of the same size and type and then try the launch again** is incorrect because the capacity error is not related to the instance size.

- The option that says: **Submit a capacity increase request to AWS as you are initially limited to only 12 instances per Placement Group** is incorrect because there is no such limit on the number of instances in a Placement Group.

### Đề bài (Question)
A multinational company has been building its new data analytics platform with high-performance computing workloads (HPC) which requires a scalable, POSIX-compliant storage service. The data need to be stored redundantly across multiple AZs and allows concurrent connections from thousands of EC2 instances hosted on multiple Availability Zones.

Which of the following AWS storage service is the most suitable one to use in this scenario?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Amazon ElastiCache
- [x] **B.** Amazon Elastic File System
- [ ] **C.** Amazon EBS Volumes
- [ ] **D.** Amazon S3

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **B**
> - **B.** Amazon Elastic File System

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
In this question, you should take note of this phrase: “allows concurrent connections from multiple EC2 instances”. There are various AWS storage options that you can choose but whenever these criteria show up, always consider using EFS instead of using EBS Volumes which is mainly used as a “block” storage and can only have one connection to one EC2 instance at a time.

Amazon EFS is a fully-managed service that makes it easy to set up and scale file storage in the Amazon Cloud. With a few clicks in the AWS Management Console, you can create file systems that are accessible to Amazon EC2 instances via a file system interface (using standard operating system file I/O APIs) and supports full file system access semantics (such as strong consistency and file locking).

Amazon EFS file systems can automatically scale from gigabytes to petabytes of data without needing to provision storage. Tens, hundreds, or even thousands of Amazon EC2 instances can access an Amazon EFS file system at the same time, and Amazon EFS provides consistent performance to each Amazon EC2 instance. Amazon EFS is designed to be highly durable and highly available.

### Đề bài (Question)
A software development company has hundreds of Amazon EC2 instances with multiple Application Load Balancers (ALBs) across multiple AWS Regions. The public applications hosted in their EC2 instances are accessed on their on-premises network. The company needs to reduce the number of IP addresses that it needs to regularly whitelist on the corporate firewall device.

Which of the following approach can be used to fulfill this requirement?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Create a new Lambda function that tracks the changes in the IP addresses of all ALBs across multiple AWS Regions. Schedule the function to run and update the corporate firewall every hour using Amazon CloudWatch Events.
- [ ] **B.** Launch a Network Load Balancer with an associated Elastic IP address. Set the ALBs in multiple Regions as targets.
- [x] **C.** Use AWS Global Accelerator and create an endpoint group for each AWS Region. Associate the Application Load Balancer from each region to the corresponding endpoint group.
- [ ] **D.** Use AWS Global Accelerator and create multiple endpoints for all the available AWS Regions. Associate all the private IP addresses of the EC2 instances to the corresponding endpoints.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **C**
> - **C.** Use AWS Global Accelerator and create an endpoint group for each AWS Region. Associate the Application Load Balancer from each region to the corresponding endpoint group.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**AWS Global Accelerator** is a service that improves the availability and performance of your applications with local or global users. It provides static IP addresses that act as a fixed entry point to your application endpoints in a single or multiple AWS Regions, such as your Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, or Amazon EC2 instances.

When the application usage grows, the number of IP addresses and endpoints that you need to manage also increase. AWS Global Accelerator allows you to scale your network up or down. AWS Global Accelerator lets you associate regional resources, such as load balancers and EC2 instances, to two static IP addresses. You only whitelist these addresses once in your client applications, firewalls, and DNS records.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/aws-global-accelerator-endpoint-group.png)

With AWS Global Accelerator, you can add or remove endpoints in the AWS Regions, run blue/green deployment, and A/B test without needing to update the IP addresses in your client applications. This is particularly useful for IoT, retail, media, automotive, and healthcare use cases in which client applications cannot be updated frequently.

If you have multiple resources in multiple regions, you can use AWS Global Accelerator to reduce the number of IP addresses. By creating an endpoint group, you can add all of your EC2 instances from a single region in that group. You can add additional endpoint groups for instances in other regions. After it, you can then associate the appropriate ALB endpoints to each of your endpoint groups. The created accelerator would have two static IP addresses that you can use to create a security rule in your firewall device. Instead of regularly adding the Amazon EC2 IP addresses in your firewall, you can use the static IP addresses of AWS Global Accelerator to automate the process and eliminate this repetitive task.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Use AWS Global Accelerator and create an endpoint group for each AWS Region. Associate the Application Load Balancer from each region to the corresponding endpoint group.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Use AWS Global Accelerator and create multiple endpoints for all the available AWS Regions. Associate all the private IP addresses of the EC2 instances to the corresponding endpoints** is incorrect. It is better to create one endpoint group instead of multiple endpoints. Moreover, you have to associate the ALBs in AWS Global Accelerator and not the underlying EC2 instances.

- The option that says: **Create a new Lambda function that tracks the changes in the IP addresses of all ALBs across multiple AWS Regions. Schedule the function to run and update the corporate firewall every hour using Amazon CloudWatch Events** is incorrect because this approach entails a lot of administrative overhead and takes a significant amount of time to implement. Using a custom Lambda function is actually not necessary since you can simply use AWS Global Accelerator to achieve this requirement.

- The option that says: **Launch a Network Load Balancer with an associated Elastic IP address. Set the ALBs in multiple Regions as targets** is incorrect. Although you can allocate an Elastic IP address to your ELB, it is not suitable to route traffic to your ALBs across multiple Regions. You have to use AWS Global Accelerator instead.

**Domain:** *CSAA – Design Secure Architectures*

### Đề bài (Question)
A company is using Amazon S3 to store frequently accessed data. The S3 bucket is shared with external users that will upload files regularly. A Solutions Architect needs to implement a solution that will grant the bucket owner full access to all uploaded objects in the S3 bucket.

What action should be done to achieve this task?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Enable the Requester Pays feature in the Amazon S3 bucket.
- [x] **B.** Create a bucket policy that will require the users to set the object’s ACL to `bucket-owner-full-control`.
- [ ] **C.** Enable server access logging and set up an IAM policy that will require the users to set the object’s ACL to `bucket-owner-full-control`.
- [ ] **D.** Create a CORS configuration in the S3 bucket.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **B**
> - **B.** Create a bucket policy that will require the users to set the object’s ACL to `bucket-owner-full-control`.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**Amazon S3** stores data as objects within buckets. An object is a file and any optional metadata that describes the file. To store a file in Amazon S3, you upload it to a bucket. When you upload a file as an object, you can set permissions on the object and any metadata. Buckets are containers for objects. You can have one or more buckets. You can control access for each bucket, deciding who can create, delete, and list objects in it. You can also choose the geographical Region where Amazon S3 will store the bucket and its contents and view access logs for the bucket and its objects.

![Diagram_S3_Access_Points](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/Diagram_S3_Access_Points.fa88c474dc1073aede962aaf3a6af2d6b02be933.png)

By default, an S3 object is owned by the AWS account that uploaded it even though the bucket is owned by another account. To get full access to the object, the object owner must explicitly grant the bucket owner access. You can create a bucket policy to require external users to grant `bucket-owner-full-control` when uploading objects so the bucket owner can have full access to the objects.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Create a bucket policy that will require the users to set the object’s ACL to `bucket-owner-full-control`** .

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Enable the Requester Pays feature in the Amazon S3 bucket** is incorrect because this won’t grant the bucket owner full access to the uploaded objects in the S3 bucket. With Requester Pays buckets, the requester, instead of the bucket owner, pays the cost of the request and the data download from the bucket.

- The option that says: **Create a CORS configuration in the S3 bucket ** is incorrect because this only allows cross-origin access to your Amazon S3 resources. If you need to grant the bucket owner full control in the uploaded objects, you must create a bucket policy and require external users to grant `bucket-owner-full-control` when uploading objects.

- The option that says: **Enable server access logging and set up an IAM policy that will require the users to set the bucket’s ACL to `bucket-owner-full-control` ** is incorrect because this only provides detailed records for the requests that are made to a bucket. In addition, the **`bucket-owner-full-control`** canned ACL must be associated with the bucket policy and not to an IAM policy. This will require the users to set the object’s ACL (not the bucket’s) to `bucket-owner-full-control`.

### Đề bài (Question)
A global medical research company has a molecular imaging system that provides each client with frequently updated images of what is happening inside the human body at the molecular and cellular levels. The system is hosted in AWS and the images are hosted in an S3 bucket behind a CloudFront web distribution. When a fresh batch of images is uploaded to S3, it is required to keep the previous ones in order to prevent them from being overwritten.

Which of the following is the most suitable solution to solve this issue?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Invalidate the files in your CloudFront web distribution
- [ ] **B.** Add a separate cache behavior path for the content and configure a custom object caching with a Minimum TTL of 0
- [x] **C.** Use versioned objects
- [ ] **D.** Add Cache-Control no-cache, no-store, or private directives in the S3 bucket

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **C**
> - **C.** Use versioned objects

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
To control the versions of files that are served from your distribution, you can either invalidate files or give them versioned file names. If you want to update your files frequently, AWS recommends that you primarily use file versioning for the following reasons:

- Versioning enables you to control which file a request returns even when the user has a version cached either locally or behind a corporate caching proxy. If you invalidate the file, the user might continue to see the old version until it expires from those caches.

- CloudFront access logs include the names of your files, so versioning makes it easier to analyze the results of file changes.

- Versioning provides a way to serve different versions of files to different users.

- Versioning simplifies rolling forward and back between file revisions.

- Versioning is less expensive. You still have to pay for CloudFront to transfer new versions of your files to edge locations, but you don’t have to pay for invalidating files.

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- **Invalidating the files in your CloudFront web distribution** is incorrect because even though using invalidation will solve this issue, this solution is more expensive as compared to **using versioned objects** .

- **Adding a separate cache behavior path for the content and configuring a custom object caching with a Minimum TTL of 0** is incorrect because this alone is not enough to solve the problem. A cache behavior is primarily used to configure a variety of CloudFront functionality for a given URL path pattern for files on your website. Although this solution may work, it is still better to use versioned objects where you can control which image will be returned by the system even when the user has another version cached either locally or behind a corporate caching proxy.

- **Adding Cache-Control no-cache, no-store, or private directives in the S3 bucket** is incorrect because although it is right to configure your origin to add the * **Cache-Control** * or * **Expires** * header field, you should do this to your objects and not on the entire S3 bucket.

### Đề bài (Question)
A company has an application that uses multiple EC2 instances located in various AWS regions such as US East (Ohio), US West (N. California), and EU (Ireland). The manager instructed the Solutions Architect to set up a latency-based routing to route incoming traffic for [www.tutorialsdojo.com](http://www.tutorialsdojo.com/) to all the EC2 instances across all AWS regions.

Which of the following options can satisfy the given requirement?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Use a Network Load Balancer to distribute the load to the multiple EC2 instances across all AWS Regions.
- [x] **B.** Use Route 53 to distribute the load to the multiple EC2 instances across all AWS Regions.
- [ ] **C.** Use AWS DataSync to distribute the load to the multiple EC2 instances across all AWS Regions.
- [ ] **D.** Use an Application Load Balancer to distribute the load to the multiple EC2 instances across all AWS Regions.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **B**
> - **B.** Use Route 53 to distribute the load to the multiple EC2 instances across all AWS Regions.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
If your application is hosted in multiple AWS Regions, you can improve performance for your users by serving their requests from the AWS Region that provides the lowest latency.

You can create latency records for your resources in multiple AWS Regions by using latency-based routing. In the event that Route 53 receives a DNS query for your domain or subdomain such as tutorialsdojo.com or portal.tutorialsdojo.com, it determines which AWS Regions you’ve created latency records for, determines which region gives the user the lowest latency, and then selects a latency record for that region. Route 53 responds with the value from the selected record which can be the IP address for a web server or the CNAME of your elastic load balancer.

Hence, **using Route 53 to distribute the load to the multiple EC2 instances across all AWS Regions** is the correct answer.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/weighted_then_geo_1.png)

 **Using a Network Load Balancer to distribute the load to the multiple EC2 instances across all AWS Regions** and **using an Application Load Balancer to distribute the load to the multiple EC2 instances across all AWS Regions** are both incorrect because load balancers distribute traffic only within their respective regions and not to other AWS regions by default. Although Network Load Balancers support connections from clients to IP-based targets in peered VPCs across different AWS Regions, the scenario didn’t mention that the VPCs have peered with each other. It is best to use Route 53 instead to balance the incoming load to two or more AWS regions more effectively.

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- **Using AWS DataSync to distribute the load to the multiple EC2 instances across all AWS Regions** is incorrect because the AWS DataSync service simply provides a fast way to move large amounts of data online between on-premises storage and Amazon S3 or Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS).

### Đề bài (Question)
A company plans to implement a network monitoring system in AWS. The Solutions Architect launched an EC2 instance to host the monitoring system and used CloudWatch to monitor, store, and access the log files of the instance.

Which of the following provides an automated way to send log data to CloudWatch Logs from the Amazon EC2 instance?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** AWS Transfer for SFTP
- [ ] **B.** CloudTrail Processing Library
- [ ] **C.** CloudTrail with log file validation
- [x] **D.** CloudWatch Logs agent

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **D**
> - **D.** CloudWatch Logs agent

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**CloudWatch Logs** enables you to centralize the logs from all of your systems, applications, and AWS services that you use, in a single, highly scalable service. You can then easily view them, search them for specific error codes or patterns, filter them based on specific fields, or archive them securely for future analysis. CloudWatch Logs enables you to see all of your logs, regardless of their source, as a single and consistent flow of events ordered by time, and you can query them and sort them based on other dimensions, group them by specific fields, create custom computations with a powerful query language, and visualize log data in dashboards.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/cloudwatch-agent-logs-tutorialsdojo.png)

The CloudWatch Logs agent is comprised of the following components:

– A plug-in to the AWS CLI that pushes log data to CloudWatch Logs.

– A script (daemon) that initiates the process to push data to CloudWatch Logs.

– A cron job that ensures that the daemon is always running.

CloudWatch Logs agent provides an automated way to send log data to CloudWatch Logs from Amazon EC2 instances hence, **CloudWatch Logs agent** is the correct answer.

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- **CloudTrail with log file validation** is incorrect as this is mainly used for tracking the API calls of your AWS resources and not for sending EC2 logs to CloudWatch.

- **AWS Transfer for SFTP** is incorrect as this is only a fully managed SFTP service for Amazon S3 used for tracking the traffic coming into the VPC and not for EC2 instance monitoring. This service enables you to easily move your file transfer workloads that use the Secure Shell File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) to AWS without needing to modify your applications or manage any SFTP servers. This can’t be used to send log data from your EC2 instance to Amazon CloudWatch.

- **CloudTrail Processing Library** is incorrect because this is just a Java library that provides an easy way to process AWS CloudTrail logs. It cannot send your log data to CloudWatch Logs.

### Đề bài (Question)
A company is running an on-premises application backed by a 1TB MySQL 8.0 database. A couple of times each month, the production data is fully copied to a staging database at the request of the analytics team. The team can’t work on the staging database until the copy is finished, which takes hours.

Throughout this period, the application experiences intermittent downtimes as well. To expedite the process for the analytics team, a solutions architect must redesign the application’s architecture in AWS. The application must also be highly resilient to disruptions.

Which combination of actions best satisfies the given set of requirements while being the most cost-effective? (Select TWO)

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Use an Amazon RDS database in a Multi-AZ Deployments configuration
- [ ] **B.** Replicate the production database to a staging database using the `mysqldump` client utility
- [x] **C.** Use an Amazon Aurora database with Multi-AZ Replicas.
- [x] **D.** Clone the production database in the staging environment using Aurora cloning.
- [ ] **E.** Take a manual snapshot and restore it to a database in the staging environment.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **C, D**
> - **C.** Use an Amazon Aurora database with Multi-AZ Replicas.
> - **D.** Clone the production database in the staging environment using Aurora cloning.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
The resiliency of an application pertains to its ability to recover from infrastructure or service disruptions. Both Amazon Aurora and Amazon RDS can give you a highly resilient infrastructure by deploying replicas in multiple availability zones. Both database services can perform an automatic failover to a standby instance in the event of failure. However, only Amazon Aurora has the ability to replicate a database in a fast and efficient manner without impacting performance, thanks to its underlying storage system. By using Aurora cloning, you can create a new cluster that uses the same Aurora cluster volume and has the same data as the original. The process is designed to be fast and cost-effective. The new cluster with its associated data volume is called a clone.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/aurora-cloning-create-clone.jpg)

Creating a clone is faster and more space-efficient than physically copying the data using other techniques, such as restoring from a snapshot like you would in Amazon RDS or using the native `mysqldump` utility.

Therefore, the correct answers are:

 **– Use an Amazon Aurora database with Multi-AZ Replicas.**

 **– Clone the production database in the staging environment using Aurora cloning.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Use an Amazon RDS database in a Multi-AZ Deployments configuration** is incorrect. While Amazon RDS is a valid option, Amazon Aurora best fits what’s described in the scenario due to its cloning feature.

- The option that says: **Take a manual snapshot and restore it to a database in the staging environment** is incorrect. Using Aurora Cloning is a faster and more cost-effective method than restoring from a snapshot.

- The option that says: **Replicate the production database to a staging database using the `mysqldump` client utility** is incorrect as this is a slow process and will impact the performance of the source database.

### Đề bài (Question)
A company has an application architecture that stores both the access key ID and the secret access key in a plain text file on a custom Amazon Machine Image (AMI). The EC2 instances, which are created by using this AMI, are using the stored access keys to connect to a DynamoDB table.

What should the Solutions Architect do to make the current architecture more secure?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Put the access keys in Amazon Glacier instead.
- [ ] **B.** Do nothing. The architecture is already secure because the access keys are already in the Amazon Machine Image.
- [ ] **C.** Put the access keys in an Amazon S3 bucket instead.
- [x] **D.** Remove the stored access keys in the AMI. Create a new IAM role with permissions to access the DynamoDB table and assign it to the EC2 instances.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **D**
> - **D.** Remove the stored access keys in the AMI. Create a new IAM role with permissions to access the DynamoDB table and assign it to the EC2 instances.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
You should use an IAM role to manage *temporary* credentials for applications that run on an EC2 instance. When you use an IAM role, you don’t have to distribute long-term credentials (such as a user name and password or access keys) to an EC2 instance.

Instead, the role supplies temporary permissions that applications can use when they make calls to other AWS resources. When you launch an EC2 instance, you specify an IAM role to associate with the instance. Applications that run on the instance can then use the role-supplied temporary credentials to sign API requests.

Hence, the best option here is to remove the stored access keys first in the AMI. Then, create a new IAM role with permissions to access the DynamoDB table and assign it to the EC2 instances.

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- **Putting the access keys in Amazon Glacier** or **in an Amazon S3 bucket** are incorrect because S3 and Glacier are mainly used as a storage option. It is better to use an IAM role instead of storing access keys in these storage services.

- The option that says: **Do nothing. The architecture is already secure because the access keys are already in the Amazon Machine Image** is incorrect because you can make the architecture more secure by using IAM.

### Đề bài (Question)
An airline company receives a lot of requests to book flights, update booking details, and flight check-ins. Since these requests flood the customer support teams, the management wants to build a self-service solution that can handle these requests without a human agent. This solution should be text-based, allowing users to type concerns in a chat box while AI analyzes intentions, provides answers, or fulfills predefined actions automatically.

Which of the following options is the recommended solution for the above requirements?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Create a conversational chatbot using Amazon Comprehend for natural-language processing (NLP). Depending on the user’s intent, invoke AWS Lambda functions that can perform the needed actions.
- [ ] **B.** Deploy a conversational chatbot using Amazon Rekognition. Define conversation flow for specific user intentions. Create AWS Lambda functions that can be invoked depending on user intentions.
- [x] **C.** Deploy a conversational chatbot using Amazon Lex. Define conversation flow for specific user intentions. Integrate AWS Lambda functions as code hooks to perform actions based on user requests.
- [ ] **D.** Work with an AWS Managed Service Provider (MSP) to deploy a conversational chatbot using Amazon Polly for natural-language processing (NLP) and Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) to enhance spoken responses. Integrate AWS Lambda functions as code hooks to perform actions based on user requests.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **C**
> - **C.** Deploy a conversational chatbot using Amazon Lex. Define conversation flow for specific user intentions. Integrate AWS Lambda functions as code hooks to perform actions based on user requests.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**Amazon Lex** enables you to build applications using a speech or text interface powered by the same technology that powers Amazon Alexa. Amazon Lex provides deep functionality and flexibility in natural language understanding (NLU) and automatic speech recognition (ASR), so you can build highly engaging user experiences with lifelike conversational interactions and create new categories of products.

 **Amazon Lex** enables any developer to build conversational chatbots quickly. With Amazon Lex, no deep learning expertise is necessary—to create a bot, you just specify the basic conversation flow in the Amazon Lex console. The console provides a graphical user interface that you can use to build a production-ready bot for your application.

![Amazon Lex](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/saa_amazon_lex.jpg)

After you create a bot, you deploy it on one of the supported platforms or integrate it into your own application. When a user interacts with the bot, the client application sends requests to the bot using the Amazon Lex runtime API. For example, when a user says, “I want to order pizza,” your client sends this input to Amazon Lex using one of the runtime API operations. Users can provide input as speech or text.

You can also create **Lambda functions** and use them in an intent. Use these Lambda function code hooks to perform runtime activities such as initialization, validation of user input, and intent fulfillment.

Therefore, the correct answer is: **Deploy a conversational chatbot using Amazon Lex. Define conversation flow for specific user intentions. Integrate AWS Lambda functions as code hooks to perform actions based on user requests.** With Amazon Lex, you can build conversational chatbots quickly. You can configure intents and actions depending on text inputted by users.

- The option that says: **Create a conversational chatbot using Amazon Comprehend for natural-language processing (NLP). Depending on the user’s intent, invoke AWS Lambda functions that can perform the needed actions** is incorrect. Amazon Comprehend is a natural language processing (NLP) service that uses machine learning to find insights and relationships in texts. It is not used to build chatbot applications.

- The option that says: **Work with an AWS Managed Service Provider (MSP) to deploy a conversational chatbot using Amazon Polly for natural-language processing (NLP) and Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) to enhance spoken responses. Integrate AWS Lambda functions as code hooks to perform actions based on user requests** is incorrect. Amazon Polly converts text into lifelike speech. It is primarily designed for text-to-speech applications, often enhanced with SSML, not for conversational chatbots. In addition, the AWS Managed Service Provider (MSP) program simply validates AWS Partners with a proven track record and experience, providing end-to-end AWS solutions to customers at any stage of the cloud journey. You don’t need an MSP to deploy an Amazon Polly chatbot.

- The option that says: **Deploy a conversational chatbot using Amazon Rekognition. Define conversation flow for specific user intentions. Create AWS Lambda functions that can be invoked depending on user intentions** is incorrect. Amazon Rekognition is typically used to identify objects, people, text, scenes, and activities in images and videos, not to build chatbot applications.

## Câu 23 (Chọn 1 đáp án (Single Choice))
**Domain:** *CSAA – Design Resilient Architectures*

### Đề bài (Question)
An application is using an AWS Lambda function to process complex financial data that runs for 15 minutes on average. The Lambda function has been configured with the maximum memory allocation to handle the computational demands of the financial data processing. Most invocations were successfully processed. However, a few terminated invocations were noticed throughout the day, which caused a data discrepancy in the application.

Which of the following is the most likely cause of this issue?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** The concurrent execution limit has been reached.
- [ ] **B.** The Lambda function contains a recursive code and has been running for over 15 minutes.
- [ ] **C.** The failed Lambda Invocations contain a `ServiceException` error which means that the Lambda service encountered an internal error.
- [x] **D.** The failed Lambda functions have been running for over 15 minutes and reached the maximum execution time.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **D**
> - **D.** The failed Lambda functions have been running for over 15 minutes and reached the maximum execution time.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
An **AWS** **Lambda function** consists of code and any associated dependencies. In addition, a Lambda function also has configuration information associated with it. Initially, you specify the configuration information when you create a Lambda function. Lambda provides an API for you to update some of the configuration data.

You pay for the AWS resources that are used to run your Lambda function. To prevent your Lambda function from running indefinitely, you specify a **timeout** . When the specified timeout is reached, AWS Lambda terminates execution of your Lambda function. It is recommended that you set this value based on your expected execution time. The default timeout is 3 seconds, and the maximum execution duration per request in AWS Lambda is 900 seconds, which is equivalent to 15 minutes.

![Timeout settings](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/2019-01-16_00-06-49-7fc593e456d2ce9edb7d49cf69d68e7e.png)

Take note that you can invoke a Lambda function synchronously either by calling the `Invoke` operation or by using an AWS SDK in your preferred runtime. If you anticipate a long-running Lambda function, your client may time out before function execution completes. To avoid this, update the client timeout or your SDK configuration.

Hence, the correct answer is: **The failed Lambda functions have been running for over 15 minutes and reached the maximum execution time.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **The concurrent execution limit has been reached** is incorrect because, by default, the AWS Lambda typically limits the total concurrent executions across all functions within a given region to 1000. By setting a concurrency limit on a function, Lambda guarantees that allocation will be applied specifically to that function, regardless of the amount of traffic processing the remaining functions. If that limit is exceeded, the function will be throttled but not terminated, which is in contrast with what is happening in the scenario.

- The option that says: **The Lambda function contains a recursive code and has been running for over 15 minutes** is incorrect because having a recursive code in your Lambda function just does not directly result in an abrupt termination of the function execution. This is a scenario wherein the function automatically calls itself until some arbitrary criteria are met. This could lead to an unintended volume of function invocations and escalated costs, but not an abrupt termination because Lambda will throttle all invocations to the function.

- The option that says: **The failed Lambda Invocations contain a `ServiceException` error which means that the Lambda service encountered an internal error** is incorrect. Although this is a valid root cause, it is unlikely to have several `ServiceException` errors throughout the day unless there is an outage or disruption in AWS. Since the scenario says that the Lambda function runs for about 10 to 15 minutes, the maximum execution duration is the most likely cause of the issue, and not the AWS Lambda service encountered an internal error.

### Đề bài (Question)
A tech company is having an issue whenever they try to connect to the newly created EC2 instance using a Remote Desktop connection from a computer. Upon checking, the Solutions Architect has verified that the instance has a public IP and the Internet gateway and route tables are in place.

What else should he do to resolve this issue?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** You should create a new instance since there might be some issue with the instance
- [x] **B.** Adjust the security group to allow inbound traffic on port 3389 from the company’s IP address.
- [ ] **C.** You should restart the EC2 instance since there might be some issue with the instance
- [ ] **D.** Adjust the security group to allow inbound traffic on port 22 from the company’s IP address.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **B**
> - **B.** Adjust the security group to allow inbound traffic on port 3389 from the company’s IP address.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
Since you are using a Remote Desktop connection to access your EC2 instance, you have to ensure that the Remote Desktop Protocol is allowed in the security group. By default, the server listens on TCP port 3389 and UDP port 3389.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/ec2-sg-rdp.PNG)

Hence, the correct answer is: **Adjust the security group to allow inbound traffic on port 3389 from the company’s IP address.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Adjust the security group to allow inbound traffic on port 22 from the company’s IP address** is incorrect as port 22 is used for SSH connections and not for RDP.

- The options that say: **You should restart the EC2 instance since there might be some issue with the instance** and **You should create a new instance since there might be some issue with the instance** are incorrect as the EC2 instance is newly created and hence, unlikely to cause the issue. You have to check the security group first if it allows the Remote Desktop Protocol (3389) before investigating if there is indeed an issue on the specific instance.

**Domain:** *CSAA – Design High-Performing Architectures*

### Đề bài (Question)
A manufacturing company launched a new type of IoT sensor that collects large streams of data records. A Solutions Architect needs to design a solution that can ingest and analyze the data in real time with millisecond response times.

Which of the following is the best option that should be implemented in this scenario?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [x] **A.** Ingest the data using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and create an AWS Lambda function to store the data in Amazon DynamoDB.
- [ ] **B.** Ingest the data using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and create an AWS Lambda function to store the data in Amazon Redshift.
- [ ] **C.** Ingest the data by directly writing to Amazon DynamoDB using Provisioned Capacity mode with 1,000 Read Capacity Units (RCU) and 1,000 Write Capacity Units (WCU).
- [ ] **D.** Ingest the data using Amazon Simple Queue Service and create an AWS Lambda function to store the data in Amazon Redshift.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **A**
> - **A.** Ingest the data using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and create an AWS Lambda function to store the data in Amazon DynamoDB.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**Amazon Kinesis Data Streams** is a fully managed service that enables applications to collect, process, and analyze large streams of data in real time. It can continuously ingest streaming data such as application logs, IoT telemetry, clickstreams, and event data from thousands of producers. The service allows multiple consumers to process the data as it arrives, enabling near real-time analytics and stream processing with very low latency.

![How Amazon Kinesis Data Streams works](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/product-page-diagram_Amazon-Kinesis-Data-Streams.074de94302fd60948e1ad070e425eeda73d350e7.png)

In this scenario, the IoT sensors generate a continuous flow of data records that must be ingested and processed in real time. Amazon Kinesis Data Streams is well-suited for this requirement because it is designed specifically for high-throughput streaming ingestion and allows applications to process records within seconds of arrival. **AWS Lambda** can be integrated with Kinesis Data Streams to automatically process incoming records without provisioning servers.

To meet the requirement for millisecond response times, the processed data can be stored in **Amazon DynamoDB** . DynamoDB is a fully managed NoSQL database that provides single-digit millisecond latency for reads and writes at any scale. This makes it ideal for real-time applications that require fast access to large volumes of streaming data.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Ingest the data using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and create an AWS Lambda function to store the data in Amazon DynamoDB.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Ingest the data using Amazon Kinesis Data Streams and create an AWS Lambda function to store the data in Amazon Redshift** is incorrect because Amazon Redshift only delivers sub-second response times. Take note that, as per the scenario, the solution must have millisecond response times to meet the requirements. Amazon DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX), which is a fully managed, highly available, in-memory cache for Amazon DynamoDB, can deliver microsecond response times.

- The option that says: **Ingest the data by directly writing to Amazon DynamoDB using Provisioned Capacity mode with 1,000 Read Capacity Units (RCU) and 1,000 Write Capacity Units (WCU)** is incorrect because Provisioned Throughput mode is typically used when an application has predictable and consistent read and write traffic. However, Amazon DynamoDB is not for ingesting and processing high-throughput streaming data. DynamoDB just stores and retrieves data efficiently, whereas services like Amazon Kinesis Data Streams are built to collect and process large streams of real-time data before storing the results in a database like DynamoDB.

- The option that says: **Ingest the data using Amazon Simple Queue Service and create an AWS Lambda function to store the data in Amazon Redshift** is incorrect because Amazon SQS can’t analyze data in real time. You have to use an Amazon Kinesis Data Stream to process the data in near-real-time.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**Amazon Kinesis** makes it easy to collect, process, and analyze real-time, streaming data so you can get timely insights and react quickly to new information. It offers key capabilities to cost-effectively process streaming data at any scale, along with the flexibility to choose the tools that best suit the requirements of your application.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/product-page-diagram_Amazon-Kinesis_Evolve-from-batch-to-real-time-Analytics.d7ed76be304a30be5720fd159469f157e7c09ede.png)

With Amazon Kinesis, you can ingest real-time data such as video, audio, application logs, website clickstreams, and IoT telemetry data for machine learning, analytics, and other applications. Amazon Kinesis enables you to process and analyze data as it arrives and responds instantly instead of having to wait until all your data are collected before the processing can begin.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Amazon Kinesis.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Amazon Elastic MapReduce (EMR)** is incorrect because EMR is primarily used for big data processing, often in batch mode, using frameworks like Hadoop and Spark. It’s great for processing vast amounts of data, but it’s not optimized for real-time streaming data.

- The option that says: **Amazon AppStream** is incorrect because this service is typically used for streaming desktop applications to end users. It’s not designed for handling and processing streams of data.

- The option that says: **Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) ** is incorrect because SQS is a message queuing service that ensures message delivery between distributed components, but it’s not optimized for real-time processing of high-velocity data streams. It’s better suited for tasks that can handle a bit of latency.

**Domain:** *CSAA – Design Secure Architectures*

### Đề bài (Question)
A company created a VPC with a single subnet then launched an On-Demand EC2 instance in that subnet. You have attached an Internet gateway (IGW) to the VPC and verified that the EC2 instance has a public IP. The main route table of the VPC is as shown below:

![](../data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E)

However, the instance still cannot be reached from the Internet when you tried to connect to it from your computer. Which of the following should be made to the route table to fix this issue?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [x] **A.** Add this new entry to the route table: 0.0.0.0/0 -> Your Internet Gateway
- [ ] **B.** Add this new entry to the route table: 0.0.0.0/27 -> Your Internet Gateway
- [ ] **C.** Modify the above route table: 10.0.0.0/27 -> Your Internet Gateway
- [ ] **D.** Add the following entry to the route table: 10.0.0.0/27 -> Your Internet Gateway

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **A**
> - **A.** Add this new entry to the route table: 0.0.0.0/0 -> Your Internet Gateway

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
Apparently, the route table does not have an entry for the Internet Gateway. This is why you cannot connect to the EC2 instance. To fix this, you have to add a route with a destination of `0.0.0.0/0` for IPv4 traffic or `::/0` for IPv6 traffic, and then a target of the Internet gateway ID (`igw-xxxxxxxx`).

This should be the correct route table configuration after adding the new entry.

### Đề bài (Question)
A company plans to host a movie streaming app in AWS. The chief information officer (CIO) wants to ensure that the application is highly available and scalable. The application is deployed to an AWS Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances on multiple AZs with NAT gateways configured for outbound internet traffic. A load balancer must be configured to distribute incoming requests evenly to all EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones.

Which of the following features should the Solutions Architect use to satisfy these criteria?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM)
- [x] **B.** Cross-zone load balancing
- [ ] **C.** AWS Direct Connect SiteLink
- [ ] **D.** Path-based Routing

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **B**
> - **B.** Cross-zone load balancing

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
The nodes for your load balancer distribute requests from clients to registered targets. When cross-zone load balancing is enabled, each load balancer node distributes traffic across the registered targets in all enabled Availability Zones. When cross-zone load balancing is disabled, each load balancer node distributes traffic only across the registered targets in its Availability Zone.

The following diagrams demonstrate the effect of cross-zone load balancing. There are two enabled Availability Zones, with two targets in Availability Zone A and eight targets in Availability Zone B. Clients send requests, and Amazon Route 53 responds to each request with the IP address of one of the load balancer nodes. This distributes traffic such that each load balancer node receives 50% of the traffic from the clients. Each load balancer node distributes its share of the traffic across the registered targets in its scope.

If cross-zone load balancing is enabled, each of the 10 targets receives 10% of the traffic. This is because each load balancer node can route 50% of the client traffic to all 10 targets.

![Cross-Zone load balancing](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/cross-zone-load-balancing-aws.png)

If cross-zone load balancing is disabled:

– Each of the two targets in Availability Zone A receives 25% of the traffic.

– Each of the eight targets in Availability Zone B receives 6.25% of the traffic.

This is because each load balancer node can route 50% of the client traffic only to targets in its Availability Zone.

![Cross-zone load balancing](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/cross-zone-load-balancing-aws-2.png)

With Application Load Balancers, cross-zone load balancing is always enabled.

With Network Load Balancers and Gateway Load Balancers, cross-zone load balancing is disabled by default. After you create the load balancer, you can enable or disable cross-zone load balancing at any time.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Cross-zone load balancing.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- **Amazon VPC IP Address Manager (IPAM)** is incorrect because this is merely a feature in Amazon VPC that provides network administrators with an automated IP management workflow. It does not enable your load balancers to distribute incoming requests evenly to all EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones.

- **Path-based Routing** is incorrect because this feature is based on the paths that are in the URL of the request. It automatically routes traffic to a particular target group based on the request URL. This feature will not set each of the load balancer nodes to distribute traffic across the registered targets in all enabled Availability Zones.

- **AWS Direct Connect SiteLink** is incorrect because this is a feature of AWS Direct Connect connections and not of Amazon Elastic Load Balancing. The AWS Direct Connect SiteLink feature simply lets you create connections between your on-premises networks through the AWS global network backbone.

A tech company is running two production web servers hosted on Reserved EC2 instances with EBS-backed root volumes. These instances have a consistent CPU load of 90%. Traffic is being distributed to these instances by an Elastic Load Balancer. In addition, they also have Multi-AZ RDS MySQL databases for their production, test, and development environments.

What recommendation would you make to reduce cost in this AWS environment without affecting availability and performance of mission-critical systems? Choose the best answer.

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [x] **A.** Consider not using a Multi-AZ RDS deployment for the development and test database
- [ ] **B.** Consider removing the Elastic Load Balancer
- [ ] **C.** Consider using On-demand instances instead of Reserved EC2 instances
- [ ] **D.** Consider using Spot instances instead of reserved EC2 instances

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **A**
> - **A.** Consider not using a Multi-AZ RDS deployment for the development and test database

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
One thing that you should notice here is that the company is using Multi-AZ databases in all of their environments, including their development and test environment. This is costly and unnecessary as these two environments are not critical. It is better to use Multi-AZ for production environments to reduce costs, which is why the option that says: **Consider not using a Multi-AZ RDS deployment for the development and test database** is the correct answer.

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Consider using On-demand instances instead of Reserved EC2 instances** is incorrect because selecting Reserved instances is cheaper than On-demand instances for long term usage due to the discounts offered when purchasing reserved instances.

- The option that says: **Consider using Spot instances instead of reserved EC2 instances** is incorrect because the web servers are running in a production environment. Never use Spot instances for production level web servers unless you are sure that they are not that critical in your system. This is because your spot instances can be terminated once the maximum price goes over the maximum amount that you specified.

- The option that says: **Consider removing the Elastic Load Balancer** is incorrect because the Elastic Load Balancer is crucial in maintaining the elasticity and reliability of your system.

- [ ] **C.** Enable Multi-Factor Authentication for the user.
- [ ] **D.** Do nothing as the IAM User is already capable of sending API calls to your AWS resources.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **B**
> - **B.** Create a set of Access Keys for the user and attach the necessary permissions.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
You can choose the credentials that are right for your IAM user. When you use the AWS Management Console to create a user, you must choose to include at least a console password or access keys. By default, a brand new IAM user created using the AWS CLI or AWS API has no credentials of any kind. You must create the type of credentials for an IAM user based on the needs of your user.

Access keys are long-term credentials for an IAM user or the AWS account root user. You can use access keys to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI or AWS API (directly or using the AWS SDK). Users need their own access keys to make programmatic calls to AWS from the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), Tools for Windows PowerShell, the AWS SDKs, or direct HTTP calls using the APIs for individual AWS services.

To fill this need, you can create, modify, view, or rotate access keys (access key IDs and secret access keys) for IAM users. When you create an access key, IAM returns the access key ID and secret access key. You should save these in a secure location and give them to the user.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/iam-intro-federation.diagram.png)

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Do nothing as the IAM User is already capable of sending API calls to your AWS resources** is incorrect because by default, a brand new IAM user created using the AWS CLI or AWS API has no credentials of any kind. Take note that in the scenario, you created the new IAM user using the AWS CLI and not via the AWS Management Console, where you must choose to at least include a console password or access keys when creating a new IAM user.

- **Enabling Multi-Factor Authentication for the user** is incorrect because this will still not provide the required Access Keys needed to send API calls to your AWS resources. You have to grant the IAM user with Access Keys to meet the requirement.

- **Assigning an IAM Policy to the user to allow it to send API calls** is incorrect because adding a new IAM policy to the new user will not grant the needed Access Keys needed to make API calls to the AWS resources.

### Đề bài (Question)
A company has several EC2 Reserved Instances in their account that need to be decommissioned and shut down since they are no longer used by the development team. However, the data is still required by the audit team for compliance purposes.

Which of the following steps can be taken in this scenario? (Select TWO.)

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [x] **A.** Take snapshots of the EBS volumes and terminate the EC2 instances.
- [x] **B.** You can opt to sell these EC2 instances on the AWS Reserved Instance Marketplace
- [ ] **C.** Convert the EC2 instances to Spot instances with a persistent Spot request type.
- [ ] **D.** Convert the EC2 instance to On-Demand instances
- [ ] **E.** Stop all the running EC2 instances.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **A, B**
> - **A.** Take snapshots of the EBS volumes and terminate the EC2 instances.
> - **B.** You can opt to sell these EC2 instances on the AWS Reserved Instance Marketplace

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2)** is a web service that provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud. It is designed to make web-scale cloud computing easier for developers. Amazon EC2’s simple web service interface allows you to obtain and configure capacity with minimal friction. It provides you with complete control of your computing resources and lets you run on Amazon’s proven computing environment.

The first requirement as per the scenario is to decommission and shut down several EC2 Reserved Instances. However, it is also mentioned that the audit team still requires the data for compliance purposes. To fulfill the given requirements, you can first create a snapshot of the instance to save its data and then sell the instance to the Reserved Instance Marketplace.

The Reserved Instance Marketplace is a platform that supports the sale of third-party and AWS customers’ unused Standard Reserved Instances, which vary in terms of length and pricing options. For example, you may want to sell Reserved Instances after moving instances to a new AWS region, changing to a new instance type, ending projects before the term expiration, when your business needs change, or if you have unneeded capacity.

Hence, the correct answers are:

 **– You can opt to sell these EC2 instances on the AWS Reserved Instance Marketplace.**

 **– Take snapshots of the EBS volumes and terminate the EC2 instances.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Convert the EC2 instance to On-Demand instances** is incorrect because it’s stated in the scenario that the development team no longer needs several EC2 Reserved Instances. By converting it to On-Demand instances, the company will still have instances running in their infrastructure and this will result in additional costs.

- The option that says: **Convert the EC2 instances to Spot instances with a persistent Spot request type** is incorrect because the requirement in the scenario is to terminate or shut down several EC2 Reserved Instances. Converting the existing instances to Spot instances will not satisfy the given requirement.

- The option that says: **Stop all the running EC2 instances** is incorrect because doing so will still incur storage cost. Take note that the requirement in the scenario is to decommission and shut down several EC2 Reserved Instances. Therefore, this approach won’t fulfill the given requirement.

### Đề bài (Question)
A company is using an Amazon RDS for MySQL 5.6 with Multi-AZ deployment enabled and several web servers across two AWS Regions. The database is currently experiencing highly dynamic reads due to the growth of the company’s website. The Solutions Architect tried to test the read performance from the secondary AWS Region and noticed a notable slowdown on the SQL queries.

Which of the following options would provide a read replication latency of less than 1 second?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [x] **A.** Migrate the existing database to Amazon Aurora and create a cross-region read replica.
- [ ] **B.** Upgrade the MySQL database engine.
- [ ] **C.** Use Amazon ElastiCache to improve database performance.
- [ ] **D.** Create an Amazon RDS for MySQL read replica in the secondary AWS Region.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **A**
> - **A.** Migrate the existing database to Amazon Aurora and create a cross-region read replica.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**Amazon Aurora** is a MySQL and PostgreSQL-compatible relational database built for the cloud, that combines the performance and availability of traditional enterprise databases with the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of open source databases. Amazon Aurora is up to five times faster than standard MySQL databases and three times faster than standard PostgreSQL databases.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/AWS-Aurora-CRRR.png)

It provides the security, availability, and reliability of commercial databases at 1/10th the cost. Amazon Aurora is fully managed by Amazon RDS, which automates time-consuming administration tasks like hardware provisioning, database setup, patching, and backups.

Based on the given scenario, there is a significant slowdown after testing the read performance from the secondary AWS Region. Since the existing setup is an Amazon RDS for MySQL, you should migrate the database to Amazon Aurora and create a cross-region read replica.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/amazon_aurora_cross_region_read_replica.png)

The read replication latency of less than 1 second is only possible if you would use Amazon Aurora replicas. Aurora replicas are independent endpoints in an Aurora DB cluster, best used for scaling read operations and increasing availability. You can create up to 15 replicas within an AWS Region.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Migrate the existing database to Amazon Aurora and create a cross-region read replica.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Upgrade the MySQL database engine** is incorrect because upgrading the database engine wouldn’t improve the read replication latency to milliseconds. To achieve the read replication latency of less than 1-second requirement, you need to use Amazon Aurora replicas.

- The option that says: **Use Amazon ElastiCache to improve database performance** is incorrect. Amazon ElastiCache won’t be able to improve the database performance because it is experiencing highly dynamic reads. This option would be helpful if the database frequently receives the same queries.

- The option that says: **Create an Amazon RDS for MySQL read replica in the secondary AWS Region** is incorrect because MySQL replicas won’t provide you a read replication latency of less than 1 second. RDS Read Replicas can only provide asynchronous replication in seconds and not in milliseconds. You have to use Amazon Aurora replicas in this scenario.

### Đề bài (Question)
A global news network created a CloudFront distribution for their web application. However, you noticed that the application’s origin server is being hit for each request instead of the AWS Edge locations, which serve the cached objects. The issue occurs even for the commonly requested objects.

What could be a possible cause of this issue?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [x] **A.** The Cache-Control max-age directive is set to zero.
- [ ] **B.** The file sizes of the cached objects are too large for CloudFront to handle.
- [ ] **C.** An object is only cached by CloudFront once a successful request has been made hence, the objects were not requested before, which is why the request is still directed to the origin server.
- [ ] **D.** There are two primary origins configured in your Amazon CloudFront Origin Group.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **A**
> - **A.** The Cache-Control max-age directive is set to zero.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
You can control how long your objects stay in a CloudFront cache before CloudFront forwards another request to your origin. Reducing the duration allows you to serve dynamic content. Increasing the duration means your users get better performance because your objects are more likely to be served directly from the edge cache. A longer duration also reduces the load on your origin.

Typically, CloudFront serves an object from an edge location until the cache duration that you specified passes — that is, until the object expires. After it expires, the next time the edge location gets a user request for the object, CloudFront forwards the request to the origin server to verify that the cache contains the latest version of the object.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/how-you-configure-cf.png)

The `Cache-Control` and `Expires` headers control how long objects stay in the cache. The `Cache-Control max-age` directive lets you specify how long (in seconds) you want an object to remain in the cache before CloudFront gets the object again from the origin server. The minimum expiration time CloudFront supports is 0 seconds for web distributions and 3600 seconds for RTMP distributions.

In this scenario, the main culprit is that the Cache-Control max-age directive is set to a low value, which is why the request is always directed to your origin server.

Hence, the correct answer is: **The Cache-Control max-age directive is set to zero.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **An object is only cached by CloudFront once a successful request has been made hence, the objects were not requested before, which is why the request is still directed to the origin server** is incorrect because the issue also occurs even for the commonly requested objects. This means that these objects were successfully requested before but due to a zero Cache-Control max-age directive value, it causes this issue in CloudFront.

- The option that says: **The file sizes of the cached objects are too large for CloudFront to handle** is incorrect because this is not related to the issue in caching.

- The option that says: **There are two primary origins configured in your Amazon CloudFront Origin Group** is incorrect because you cannot set two origins in CloudFront in the first place. An origin group includes two origins which are the primary origin and the second origin that will be used for the actual failover. It also includes the failover criteria that you need to specify. In this scenario, the issue is more on the cache hit ratio and not on origin failovers.

### Đề bài (Question)
A multinational corporate and investment bank regularly processes steady workloads of accruals, loan interests, and other critical financial calculations every night from 10 PM to 3 AM on their on-premises data center for their corporate clients. Once the process is done, the results are then uploaded to the Oracle General Ledger which means that the processing should not be delayed or interrupted. The CTO has decided to move its IT infrastructure to AWS to save costs. The company needs to reserve compute capacity in a specific Availability Zone to properly run their workloads.

As the Senior Solutions Architect, how can you implement a cost-effective architecture in AWS for their financial system?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Use On-Demand EC2 instances which allows you to pay for the instances that you launch and use by the second. Reserve compute capacity in a specific Availability Zone to avoid any interruption.
- [ ] **B.** Use Dedicated Hosts, which provide a physical host that is fully dedicated to running your instances, and bring your existing per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses to reduce costs.
- [ ] **C.** Use Regional Reserved Instances to reserve capacity on a specific Availability Zone and lower the operating cost through its billing discounts.
- [x] **D.** Use On-Demand Capacity Reservations, which provide compute capacity that is always available on the specified recurring schedule.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **D**
> - **D.** Use On-Demand Capacity Reservations, which provide compute capacity that is always available on the specified recurring schedule.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
On-Demand Capacity Reservations enable you to reserve compute capacity for your Amazon EC2 instances in a specific Availability Zone for any duration. This gives you the ability to create and manage Capacity Reservations independently from the billing discounts offered by Savings Plans or Regional Reserved Instances.

By creating Capacity Reservations, you ensure that you always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it, for as long as you need it. You can create Capacity Reservations at any time, without entering into a one-year or three-year term commitment, and the capacity is available immediately. Billing starts as soon as the capacity is provisioned and the Capacity Reservation enters the active state. When you no longer need it, cancel the Capacity Reservation to stop incurring charges.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/SAA-C03 - Capacity Reservation Comparison.png)

When you create a Capacity Reservation, you specify:

– The Availability Zone in which to reserve the capacity

– The number of instances for which to reserve capacity

– The instance attributes, including the instance type, tenancy, and platform/OS

Capacity Reservations can only be used by instances that match their attributes. By default, they are automatically used by running instances that match the attributes. If you don’t have any running instances that match the attributes of the Capacity Reservation, it remains unused until you launch an instance with matching attributes.

In addition, you can use Savings Plans and Regional Reserved Instances with your Capacity Reservations to benefit from billing discounts. AWS automatically applies your discount when the attributes of a Capacity Reservation match the attributes of a Savings Plan or Regional Reserved Instance.

In this scenario, the company only runs the process for 5 hours (from 10 PM to 3 AM) every night. By usinng Capacity Reservations, they not only ensure availability but can also implement automation to procure and cancel capacity, as well as terminate instances once they are no longer needed. This approach prevents them from incurring unnecessary charges, ensuring they are billed only for the resources they actually use.

Hence, the correct answer is to **use On-Demand Capacity Reservations, which provide compute capacity that is always available on the specified recurring schedule.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Use** **On-Demand EC2 instances which allows you to pay for the instances that you launch and use by the second. Reserve compute capacity in a specific Availability Zone to avoid any interruption** is incorrect because although an On-Demand instance is stable and suitable for processing critical data, it costs more than any other option. Moreover, the critical financial calculations are only done every night from 10 PM to 3 AM and not 24/7. This means that your computing capacity will not be utilized for a total of 19 hours every single day. On-Demand instances cannot reserve compute capacity at all. So this option is incorrect.

- The option that says: **Use Regional Reserved Instances to reserve capacity on a specific Availability Zone and lower the operating cost through its billing discounts.** is incorrect because this feature is available in Zonal Reserved Instances only and not on Regional Reserved Instances.

- The option that says: **Use Dedicated Hosts, which provide a physical host that is fully dedicated to running your instances, and bring your existing per-socket, per-core, or per-VM software licenses to reduce costs** is incorrect because the use of a fully dedicated physical host is not warranted in this scenario. Moreover, this will be underutilized since you only run the process for 5 hours (from 10 PM to 3 AM only), wasting 19 hours of compute capacity every single day.

**Domain:** *CSAA – Design High-Performing Architectures*

### Đề bài (Question)
A fast food company is using AWS to host its online ordering system which uses an Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances deployed across multiple Availability Zones with an Application Load Balancer in front. To better handle the incoming traffic from various digital devices, a new routing logic is being considered. Requests with URLs matching /api/android should be directed to a target group named “Android-Target-Group”. Conversely, requests which have a URL of /api/ios are forwarded to another separate target group named “iOS-Target-Group”.

How can this change be implemented in AWS?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Use host conditions to define rules that forward requests to different target groups based on the hostname in the host header. This enables you to support multiple domains using a single load balancer.
- [ ] **B.** Replace your ALB with a Gateway Load Balancer then use path conditions to define rules that forward requests to different target groups based on the URL in the request.
- [ ] **C.** Replace your ALB with a Network Load Balancer then use host conditions to define rules that forward requests to different target groups based on the URL in the request.
- [x] **D.** Use path conditions to define rules that forward requests to different target groups based on the URL in the request.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **D**
> - **D.** Use path conditions to define rules that forward requests to different target groups based on the URL in the request.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
If your application is composed of several individual services, an Application Load Balancer can route a request to a service based on the content of the request, such as Host field, Path URL, HTTP header, HTTP method, Query string, or Source IP address. Path-based routing allows you to route a client request based on the URL path of the HTTP header. Each path condition has one path pattern. If the URL in a request matches the path pattern in a listener rule exactly, the request is routed using that rule.

![Application Load Balancer - Path condition](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/path-conditions-alb-03JUL2025.png)

A path pattern is case-sensitive, can be up to 128 characters in length, and can contain any of the following characters. You can include up to three wildcard characters.

– A–Z, a–z, 0–9

– _ – . $ / ~ ” ‘ @ : +

– & (using &amp;)

– * (matches 0 or more characters)

– ? (matches exactly 1 character)

Example path patterns

– `/img/*`

– `/js/*`

You can use path conditions to define rules that forward requests to different target groups based on the URL in the request (also known as path-based routing). This type of routing is the most appropriate solution for this scenario.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Use path conditions to define rules that forward requests to different target groups based on the URL in the request.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Use host conditions to define rules that forward requests to different target groups based on the hostname in the host header. This enables you to support multiple domains using a single load balancer** is incorrect because host-based routing primarily defines rules that forward requests to different target groups based on the hostname in the host header instead of the URL, which is what is needed in this scenario.

- The option that says: **Replace your ALB with a Gateway Load Balancer then use path conditions to define rules that forward requests to different target groups based on the URL in the request** is incorrect because a Gateway Load Balancer does not support path-based routing. You must use an Application Load Balancer.

- The option that says: **Replace your ALB with a Network Load Balancer then use host conditions to define rules that forward requests to different target groups based on the URL in the request** is incorrect because a Network Load Balancer is typically used for applications that need extreme network performance and static IP. It also does not support path-based routing, which is what is needed in this scenario. Furthermore, the statement mentions host-based routing even though the scenario is about path-based routing.

### Đề bài (Question)
A Solutions Architect needs to launch a web application that will be served globally using Amazon CloudFront. The application is hosted in an Amazon EC2 instance which will be configured as the origin server to process and serve dynamic content to its customers.

Which of the following options provides high availability for the application?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Use Amazon S3 to serve the dynamic content of your web application and configure the S3 bucket to be part of an origin group.
- [ ] **B.** Use Lambda@Edge to improve the performance of your web application and ensure high availability. Set the Lambda@Edge functions to be part of an origin group.
- [ ] **C.** Launch an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances and configure it to be part of an origin group.
- [x] **D.** Provision two EC2 instances deployed in different Availability Zones and configure them to be part of an origin group.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **D**
> - **D.** Provision two EC2 instances deployed in different Availability Zones and configure them to be part of an origin group.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
An origin is a location where content is stored and from which CloudFront gets content to serve to viewers. **Amazon CloudFront** is a service that speeds up the distribution of your static and dynamic web content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your content through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests content that you’re serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest latency (time delay) so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/origingroups-overview.png)

You can also set up CloudFront with origin failover for scenarios that require high availability. An origin group may contain two origins: a primary and a secondary. If the primary origin is unavailable or returns specific HTTP response status codes that indicate a failure, CloudFront automatically switches to the secondary origin. To set up origin failover, you must have a distribution with at least two origins.

The scenario uses an EC2 instance as an origin. Take note that we can also use an EC2 instance or a custom origin in configuring CloudFront. To achieve high availability in an EC2 instance, we need to deploy the instances in two or more Availability Zones. You also need to configure the instances to be part of the origin group to ensure that the application is highly available.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Provision two EC2 instances deployed in different Availability Zones and configure them to be part of an origin group.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Use Amazon S3 to serve the dynamic content of your web application and configure the S3 bucket to be part of an origin group** is incorrect because Amazon S3 can only serve static content. If you need to host dynamic content, you have to use an Amazon EC2 instance instead.

- The option that says: **Launch an Auto Scaling group of EC2 instances and configure it to be part of an origin group** is incorrect because you must have at least two origins to set up an origin failover in CloudFront. In addition, you can’t directly use a single Auto Scaling group as an origin.

- The option that says: **Use Lambda@Edge to improve the performance of your web application and ensure high availability. Set the Lambda@Edge functions to be part of an origin group** is incorrect because Lambda@Edge is primarily used for serverless edge computing. You can’t set Lambda@Edge functions as part of your origin group in CloudFront.

> - **D.** Download the Amazon RDS Root CA certificate. Import the certificate to your servers and configure your application to use SSL to encrypt the connection to RDS.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
You can use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) to encrypt connections between your client applications and your Amazon RDS DB instances running Microsoft SQL Server. SSL support is available in all AWS regions for all supported SQL Server editions.

When you create an SQL Server DB instance, Amazon RDS creates an SSL certificate for it. The SSL certificate includes the DB instance endpoint as the Common Name (CN) for the SSL certificate to guard against spoofing attacks.

There are 2 ways to use SSL to connect to your SQL Server DB instance:

– Force SSL for all connections — this happens transparently to the client, and the client doesn’t have to do any work to use SSL.

– Encrypt specific connections — this sets up an SSL connection from a specific client computer, and you must do work on the client to encrypt connections.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/rds_sql_ssl_cert.png)

You can force all connections to your DB instance to use SSL, or you can encrypt connections from specific client computers only. To use SSL from a specific client, you must obtain certificates for the client computer, import certificates on the client computer, and then encrypt the connections from the client computer.

If you want to force SSL, use the `rds.force_ssl` parameter. By default, the `rds.force_ssl` parameter is set to `false`. Set the `rds.force_ssl` parameter to `true` to force connections to use SSL. The `rds.force_ssl` parameter is static, so after you change the value, you must reboot your DB instance for the change to take effect.

Hence, the correct answers for this scenario are the options that say:

 **– Force all connections to your DB instance to use SSL by setting the `rds.force_ssl` parameter to true. Once done, reboot your DB instance.**

 **– Download the Amazon RDS Root CA certificate. Import the certificate to your servers and configure your application to use SSL to encrypt the connection to RDS.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- **Specifying the TDE option in an RDS option group that is associated with that DB instance to enable transparent data encryption (TDE)** is incorrect because transparent data encryption (TDE) is primarily used to encrypt stored data on your DB instances running Microsoft SQL Server and not the data that is in transit.

- **Enabling the IAM DB authentication in RDS using the AWS Management Console** is incorrect because IAM database authentication is only supported in MySQL and PostgreSQL database engines. With IAM database authentication, you don’t need to use a password when you connect to a DB instance but instead, you use an authentication token.

- **Configuring the security groups of your EC2 instances and RDS to only allow traffic to and from port 443** is incorrect because it is not enough to do this. You need to either force all connections to your DB instance to use SSL, or you can encrypt connections from specific client computers, just as mentioned above.

**Domain:** *CSAA – Design Resilient Architectures*

### Đề bài (Question)
A startup is building IoT devices and monitoring applications. They are using IoT sensors to monitor the traffic in real-time by using an Amazon Kinesis Stream that is configured with default settings. It then sends the data to an Amazon S3 bucket every 3 days. When you checked the data in S3 on the 3rd day, only the data for the last day is present and no data is present from 2 days ago.

Which of the following is the MOST likely cause of this issue?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Someone has manually deleted the record in Amazon S3.
- [ ] **B.** Amazon S3 bucket has encountered a data loss.
- [x] **C.** By default, data records in Kinesis are only accessible for 24 hours from the time they are added to a stream.
- [ ] **D.** The access of the Kinesis stream to the S3 bucket is insufficient.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **C**
> - **C.** By default, data records in Kinesis are only accessible for 24 hours from the time they are added to a stream.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
By default, records of a stream in Amazon Kinesis are accessible for up to 24 hours from the time they are added to the stream. You can raise this limit to up to 7 days by enabling extended data retention.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/architecture.png)

Hence, the correct answer is: **By default, data records in Kinesis are only accessible for 24 hours from the time they are added to a stream.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Amazon S3 bucket has encountered a data loss** is incorrect because Amazon S3 rarely experiences data loss. Amazon has an SLA for S3 that it commits to its customers. Amazon S3 Standard, S3 Standard–IA, S3 One Zone-IA, and S3 Glacier are all designed to provide 99.999999999% durability of objects over a given year. This durability level corresponds to an average annual expected loss of 0.000000001% of objects. Hence, Amazon S3 bucket data loss is highly unlikely.

- The option that says: **Someone has manually deleted the record in Amazon S3** is incorrect because if someone has deleted the data, this should have been visible in CloudTrail. Also, deleting that much data manually shouldn’t have occurred in the first place if you have put in the appropriate security measures.

- The option that says: **The access of the Kinesis stream to the S3 bucket is insufficient** is incorrect because having insufficient access is highly unlikely since you are able to access the bucket and view the contents of the previous day’s data collected by Kinesis.

**Domain:** *CSAA – Design Secure Architectures*

### Đề bài (Question)
A web application, which is hosted in the on-premises data center and uses a MySQL database, must be migrated to AWS Cloud. You need to ensure that the network traffic to and from your RDS database instance is encrypted using SSL. For improved security, you have to use the profile credentials specific to your EC2 instance to access your database, instead of a password.

Which of the following should you do to meet the above requirement?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [x] **A.** Set up an RDS database and enable the IAM DB Authentication.
- [ ] **B.** Launch the mysql client using the `--ssl-ca` parameter when connecting to the database.
- [ ] **C.** Launch a new RDS database instance using Aurora with the Backtrack feature enabled.
- [ ] **D.** Configure your RDS database to enable encryption.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **A**
> - **A.** Set up an RDS database and enable the IAM DB Authentication.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
You can authenticate to your DB instance using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) database authentication. IAM database authentication works with MySQL and PostgreSQL. With this authentication method, you don’t need to use a password when you connect to a DB instance. Instead, you use an authentication token.

An *authentication token* is a unique string of characters that Amazon RDS generates on request. Authentication tokens are generated using AWS Signature Version 4. Each token has a lifetime of 15 minutes. You don’t need to store user credentials in the database, because authentication is managed externally using IAM. You can also still use standard database authentication.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/amazon-rds-iam-db-authentication.png)

IAM database authentication provides the following benefits:

– Network traffic to and from the database is encrypted using Secure Sockets Layer (SSL).

– You can use IAM to centrally manage access to your database resources, instead of managing access individually on each DB instance.

– For applications running on Amazon EC2, you can use profile credentials specific to your EC2 instance to access your database instead of a password, for greater security

Hence, **setting up an RDS database and enable the IAM DB Authentication** is the correct answer since IAM DB Authentication allows the use of the profile credentials specific to your EC2 instance to access your RDS database instead of a password.

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Launch a new RDS database instance using Aurora with the Backtrack feature enabled** is incorrect because the Backtrack is a feature of Aurora that simply “rewinds” the DB cluster to the time you specify. Backtracking is not a replacement for backing up your DB cluster so that you can restore it to a point in time. However, you can easily undo mistakes using the backtrack feature if you mistakenly perform a destructive action, such as a `DELETE` without a `WHERE` clause.

- The option that says: **Configure your RDS database to enable encryption** is incorrect because this encryption feature in RDS is primarily for securing your Amazon RDS DB instances and snapshots at rest. The data that is encrypted at rest includes the underlying storage for DB instances, its automated backups, Read Replicas, and snapshots.

- The option that says: **Launch the mysql client using the `--ssl-ca` parameter when connecting to the database** is incorrect because even though using the `--ssl-ca` parameter can provide an SSL connection to your database, you still need to use the IAM database connection to use the profile credentials specific to your EC2 instance to access your database instead of a password.

## Câu 42 (Chọn 1 đáp án (Single Choice))
**Domain:** *CSAA – Design High-Performing Architectures*

### Đề bài (Question)
A company is planning to deploy a High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster in its VPC that requires a scalable, high-performance file system. The storage service must be optimized for efficient workload processing, and the data must be accessible via a fast and scalable file system interface. It should also work natively with Amazon S3 that enables you to easily process your S3 data with a high-performance POSIX interface.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable service that you should use for this scenario?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS)
- [ ] **B.** Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
- [ ] **C.** Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)
- [x] **D.** Amazon FSx for Lustre

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **D**
> - **D.** Amazon FSx for Lustre

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**Amazon FSx for Lustre** provides a high-performance file system optimized for fast processing of workloads such as machine learning, high performance computing (HPC), video processing, financial modeling, and electronic design automation (EDA). These workloads commonly require data to be presented via a fast and scalable file system interface and typically have data sets stored on long-term data stores like Amazon S3.

Operating high-performance file systems typically requires specialized expertise and administrative overhead, requiring you to provision storage servers and tune complex performance parameters. With Amazon FSx, you can launch and run a file system that provides sub-millisecond access to your data and allows you to read and write data at speeds of up to hundreds of gigabytes per second of throughput and millions of IOPS.

Amazon FSx for Lustre works natively with Amazon S3, making it easy for you to process cloud data sets with high-performance file systems. When linked to an S3 bucket, an FSx for Lustre file system transparently presents S3 objects as files and allows you to write results back to S3. You can also use FSx for Lustre as a standalone high-performance file system to burst your workloads from on-premises to the cloud. By copying on-premises data to an FSx for Lustre file system, you can make that data available for fast processing by compute instances running on AWS. With Amazon FSx, you pay for only the resources you use. There are no minimum commitments, upfront hardware or software costs, or additional fees.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/FSx_Lustre_diagram.9f3f9ca4ea7827b296033b17f885543d4c3ca778.png)

For Windows-based applications, Amazon FSx provides fully managed Windows file servers with features and performance optimized for “lift-and-shift” business-critical application workloads including home directories (user shares), media workflows, and ERP applications. It is accessible from Windows and Linux instances via the SMB protocol. If you have Linux-based applications, Amazon EFS is a cloud-native fully managed file system that provides simple, scalable, elastic file storage accessible from Linux instances via the NFS protocol.

For compute-intensive and fast processing workloads, like high-performance computing (HPC), machine learning, EDA, and media processing, Amazon FSx for Lustre, provides a file system that’s optimized for performance, with input and output stored on Amazon S3.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Amazon FSx for Lustre*.***

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- **Amazon Elastic File System (EFS)** is incorrect. Although the EFS service can be used for HPC applications, it doesn’t natively work with Amazon S3. It doesn’t have the capability to easily process your S3 data with a high-performance POSIX interface, unlike Amazon FSx for Lustre.

- **Amazon FSx for Windows File Server** is incorrect. Although this service is a type of Amazon FSx, it does not work natively with Amazon S3. This service is a fully managed native Microsoft Windows file system that is primarily used for your Windows-based applications that require shared file storage to AWS.

- **Amazon Elastic Block Storage (EBS)** is incorrect because this service is not a scalable, high-performance file system.

### Đề bài (Question)
A healthcare company has developed an AWS Lambda function to handle requests from a third-party analytics service. When new patient data is available, the service sends an `HTTP POST` request to a webhook intended to trigger the Lambda function.

What would be the MOST operationally efficient solution to ensure that the service can call the Lambda function?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [x] **A.** Generate a Lambda Function URL and use it as the webhook for the third-party analytics service.
- [ ] **B.** Attach an Amazon SQS queue to the Lambda function. Use the SQS queue URL as the webhook.
- [ ] **C.** Create an API Gateway endpoint for the Lambda function. Provide the endpoint as a webhook to the third-party analytics service.
- [ ] **D.** Launch an EC2 instance that acts as a proxy for the Lambda function. Give the instance’s public IP as a webhook to the third-party analytics service.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **A**
> - **A.** Generate a Lambda Function URL and use it as the webhook for the third-party analytics service.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**Lambda function URLs** are HTTP(S) endpoints dedicated to your Lambda function. You can easily create and set up a function URL using the Lambda console or API. Once created, Lambda generates a unique URL endpoint for your use.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/lambda-function-url-06-19-23.png)

In the scenario, creating a function URL is the simplest and most straightforward way of making the Lambda function callable by the analytics service. This also simplifies the architecture since there is no need to set up and manage an intermediary service such as API Gateway.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Generate a Lambda Function URL and use it as the webhook for the third-party analytics service.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Attach an Amazon SQS queue to the Lambda function. Use the SQS queue URL as the webhook** is incorrect. Amazon SQS is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. While you can configure a Lambda function to poll an SQS queue for messages, SQS itself does not directly accept HTTP(S) requests from outside AWS, so you cannot use an SQS URL as a webhook.

- The option that says: **Launch an EC2 instance that acts as a proxy for the Lambda function. Give the instance’s public IP as a webhook to the third-party analytics service** is incorrect. While technically possible, this is not the most operationally efficient solution. Managing an EC2 instance adds unnecessary overhead and complexity compared to just simply creating a function URL for the Lambda function.

- The option that says: **Create an API Gateway endpoint for the Lambda function. Provide the endpoint as a webhook to the third-party analytics service** is incorrect. Although this is a valid solution, it requires more configuration steps than using Lambda function URLs.

**Domain:** *CSAA – Design Cost-Optimized Architectures*

### Đề bài (Question)
A company has multiple AWS sandbox accounts that are used by its development team. All developers must be given access to the contents of one of the main account’s S3 buckets. For security purposes, any personally identifiable information (PII) or financial data uploaded in the bucket must be continuously monitored and removed.

How can this be done at the lowest possible cost and with the least amount of configuration effort?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [x] **A.** Create an S3 bucket policy that grants access from the sandbox accounts. Use Amazon Macie to discover personally identifiable information (PII) or financial data.
- [ ] **B.** Generate a pre-signed URL for the objects on the S3 bucket. Use the Amazon S3 Storage Lens to discover personally identifiable information (PII) or financial data.
- [ ] **C.** Add S3 read permission to the IAM policy of each IAM user from the sandbox accounts. Use Amazon Detective to discover personally identifiable information (PII) or financial data.
- [ ] **D.** Configure cross-account replication on the S3 bucket. Integrate AWS Audit Manager with the S3 bucket to discover any personally identifiable information (PII) or financial data.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **A**
> - **A.** Create an S3 bucket policy that grants access from the sandbox accounts. Use Amazon Macie to discover personally identifiable information (PII) or financial data.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
In Amazon S3, you can grant users in another AWS account (Account B) granular cross-account access to objects owned by your account (Account A). Depending on the type of access that you want to provide, use one of the following solutions to grant cross-account access to objects:

– AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies and resource-based bucket policies ( for programmatic-only access to S3 bucket objects

– IAM policies and resource-based Access Control Lists (ACLs) for programmatic-only access to S3 bucket objects

– Cross-account IAM roles for programmatic and console access to S3 bucket objects.

Not all AWS services support resource-based policies. Therefore, you can use cross-account IAM roles to centralize permission management when providing cross-account access to multiple services. Using cross-account IAM roles simplifies provisioning cross-account access to S3 objects that are stored in multiple S3 buckets. As a result, you don’t need to manage multiple policies for S3 buckets. This method allows cross-account access to objects owned or uploaded by another AWS account or AWS services. If you don’t use cross-account IAM roles, then the object ACL must be modified.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/amazon-s3-bucket-policy-for-cross-account-access.jpg)

In the scenario, the best approach to granting the developers access to the main account’s S3 bucket is by configuring the bucket policy to allow IAM users from different accounts to call the GetObject method. This is a neater and simpler solution than the rest because you control access from a single location without any additional costs.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Create an S3 bucket policy that grants access from the sandbox accounts. Use Amazon Macie to discover personally identifiable information (PII) or financial data.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Configure cross-account replication on the S3 bucket. Integrate AWS Audit Manager with the S3 bucket to discover any personally identifiable information (PII) or financial data** is incorrect. This can work, but it is an inefficient way of solving the problem. The developers only need to access the S3 objects in another account; they do not need to own a copy of them. On top of that, replication incurs additional costs. In addition, the AWS Audit Manager simply helps you continuously audit your AWS usage to simplify how you assess risk and compliance with regulations and industry standards. AWS Audit Manager is not capable of discovering personally identifiable information (PII) or financial data in your S3 bucket.

- The option that says: **Generate a pre-signed URL for the objects on the S3 bucket. Use the Amazon S3 Storage Lens to discover personally identifiable information (PII) or financial data** is incorrect. Since objects shared using presigned URLs are time-limited, you’d have to regenerate the URL for each object every time it expires and resend the new link to the developers. This approach does not scale well and is not a good use for the S3 presigned URL. Moreover, the Amazon S3 Storage Lens feature just provides a single view of object storage usage and activity across your entire Amazon S3 storage.

- The option that says: **Add S3 read permission to the IAM policy of each IAM user from the sandbox accounts. Use Amazon Detective to discover personally identifiable information (PII) or financial data** is incorrect. You would have to jump from one account to another to set this up. It works, but depending on the number of accounts and IAM users, it will entail a lot of configuration overhead. Although Amazon Detective is a security service, it does not have any capability to discover any PII or financial data in your S3 bucket. Its primary purpose is to analyze and visualize security data to rapidly get to the root cause of potential security issues.

### Đề bài (Question)
A multinational manufacturing company has multiple accounts in AWS to separate their various departments such as finance, human resources, engineering and many others. There is a requirement to ensure that certain access to services and actions are properly controlled to comply with the security policy of the company.

As the Solutions Architect, which is the most suitable way to set up the multi-account AWS environment of the company?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Connect all departments by setting up a cross-account access to each of the AWS accounts of the company. Create and attach IAM policies to your resources based on their respective departments to control access.
- [ ] **B.** Set up a common IAM policy that can be applied across all AWS accounts.
- [ ] **C.** Provide access to externally authenticated users via Identity Federation. Set up an IAM role to specify permissions for users from each department whose identity is federated from your organization or a third-party identity provider.
- [x] **D.** Use AWS Organizations and Service Control Policies to control services on each account.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **D**
> - **D.** Use AWS Organizations and Service Control Policies to control services on each account.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**Using AWS Organizations and Service Control Policies to control services on each account** is the correct answer. Refer to the diagram below:

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/2018-10-26_01-25-11-8da501431a6200367e0672f1387defa8.png)

AWS Organizations offers policy-based management for multiple AWS accounts. With Organizations, you can create groups of accounts, automate account creation, apply and manage policies for those groups. Organizations enable you to centrally manage policies across multiple accounts without requiring custom scripts and manual processes. It allows you to create Service Control Policies (SCPs) that centrally control AWS service use across multiple AWS accounts.

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Setting up a common IAM policy that can be applied across all AWS accounts** is incorrect because it is not possible to create a common IAM policy for multiple AWS accounts.

- The option that says: **Connect all departments by setting up a cross-account access to each of the AWS accounts of the company. Create and attach IAM policies to your resources based on their respective departments to control access** is incorrect. Although you can set up cross-account access to each department, this entails a lot of configuration compared with using AWS Organizations and Service Control Policies (SCPs). Cross-account access would be a more suitable choice if you only have two accounts to manage, but not for multiple accounts.

- The option that says: **Provide access to externally authenticated users via Identity Federation. Set up an IAM role to specify permissions for users from each department whose identity is federated from your organization or a third-party identity provider** is incorrect as this is focused on the Identity Federation authentication set up for your AWS accounts but not the IAM policy management for multiple AWS accounts. A combination of AWS Organizations and Service Control Policies (SCPs) is a better choice compared to this option.

## Câu 46 (Chọn 1 đáp án (Single Choice))
**Domain:** *CSAA – Design High-Performing Architectures*

### Đề bài (Question)
A Solutions Architect is implementing a new High-Performance Computing (HPC) system in AWS that involves orchestrating several Amazon Elastic Container Service (Amazon ECS) tasks with an Amazon EC2 launch type that is part of an ECS cluster. The ECS cluster is configured with an ECS Capacity Provider to dynamically manage and scale the EC2 instances based on ECS task demand, ensuring sufficient compute resources are always available for high-throughput workloads.

Users around the globe will frequently access the system, and it is expected that hundreds of ECS tasks will run most of the time. These tasks require high-frequency read and write operations to a shared storage system. The output data of each ECS task is around 10 MB, and although obsolete data is eventually archived and deleted, the total storage size will not exceed 10 TB.

Which of the following is the MOST suitable solution that the Architect should recommend?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [x] **A.** Launch an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with Provisioned Throughput mode and set the performance mode to ` Max I/O`. Configure the EFS file system as the container mount point in the ECS task definition of the ECS cluster.
- [ ] **B.** Launch an Amazon DynamoDB table with DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) and DynamoDB Streams enabled. Configure the table to be accessible by all ECS cluster instances. Set the DynamoDB table as the container mount point in the ECS task definition of the ECS cluster.
- [ ] **C.** Set up an SMB file share by creating an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. Set the file share as the container mount point in the ECS task definition of the ECS cluster.
- [ ] **D.** Launch an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system with Bursting Throughput mode and set the performance mode to `General Purpose`. Configure the EFS file system as the container mount point in the ECS task definition of the ECS cluster.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)

> - **A.** Launch an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with Provisioned Throughput mode and set the performance mode to ` Max I/O`. Configure the EFS file system as the container mount point in the ECS task definition of the ECS cluster.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS)** provides simple, scalable file storage for use with your Amazon ECS tasks. With Amazon EFS, storage capacity is elastic, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and remove files. Your applications can have the storage they need when they need it.

You can use Amazon EFS file systems with Amazon ECS to access file system data across your fleet of Amazon ECS tasks. That way, your tasks have access to the same persistent storage, no matter the infrastructure or container instance on which they land. When you reference your Amazon EFS file system and container mount point in your Amazon ECS task definition, Amazon ECS takes care of mounting the file system in your container.

![Amazon EFS Performance ](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/Amazon+EFS+-+Performance+and+Throughput+mode+-+SAA-C02.png)

To support a wide variety of cloud storage workloads, Amazon EFS offers two performance modes:

– General Purpose mode

– Max I/O mode.

You choose a file system’s performance mode when you create it, and it cannot be changed. The two performance modes have no additional costs, so your Amazon EFS file system is billed and metered the same, regardless of your performance mode.

There are two throughput modes to choose from for your file system:

– Bursting Throughput

– Provisioned Throughput

With Bursting Throughput mode, a file system’s throughput scales as the amount of data stored in the EFS Standard or One Zone storage class grows. File-based workloads are typically spiky, driving high levels of throughput for short periods of time, and low levels of throughput the rest of the time. To accommodate this, Amazon EFS is designed to burst to high throughput levels for periods of time.

Provisioned Throughput mode is available for applications with high throughput to storage (MiB/s per TiB) ratios, or with requirements greater than those allowed by the Bursting Throughput mode. For example, say you’re using Amazon EFS for development tools, web serving, or content management applications where the amount of data in your file system is low relative to throughput demands. Your file system can now get the high levels of throughput your applications require without having to pad your file system.

In the scenario, the file system will be frequently accessed by users around the globe so it is expected that there would be hundreds of ECS tasks running most of the time. The Architect must ensure that its storage system is optimized for high-frequency read and write operations.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Launch an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) with Provisioned Throughput mode and set the performance mode to ` Max I/O`. Configure the EFS file system as the container mount point in the ECS task definition of the ECS cluster.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Set up an SMB file share by creating an Amazon FSx for Windows File Server. Set the file share as the container mount point in the ECS task definition of the ECS cluster** is incorrect because is primarily designed for traditional Windows workloads and doesn’t provide the level of performance needed for high-frequency read and write operations in ECS tasks. It also doesn’t offer the low-latency access that is typically required in this scenario for a large number of ECS tasks.

- The option that says: **Launch an Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) file system with Bursting Throughput mode and set the performance mode to `General Purpose`. Configure the EFS file system as the container mount point in the ECS task definition of the ECS cluster** is incorrect because using Bursting Throughput mode won’t be able to sustain the constant demand of the global application. Remember that the application will be frequently accessed by users around the world and there are hundreds of ECS tasks running most of the time.

- The option that says: **Launch an Amazon DynamoDB table with DynamoDB Accelerator (DAX) and DynamoDB Streams enabled. Configure the table to be accessible by all ECS cluster instances. Set the DynamoDB table as the container mount point in the ECS task definition of the ECS cluster** is incorrect because DynamoDB is simply a database and not a file system, so it can’t be “mounted” to a server. This option typically won’t work in this scenario because DynamoDB doesn’t provide the functionality of a file system that can be directly used as a container mount point.

### Đề bài (Question)
There is a technical requirement by a financial firm that does online credit card processing to have a secure application environment on AWS. They are trying to decide on whether to use KMS or CloudHSM.

Which of the following statements is right when it comes to CloudHSM and KMS?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** AWS CloudHSM should always be used for any payment transactions.
- [ ] **B.** No major difference. They both do the same thing.
- [ ] **C.** If you want a managed service for creating and controlling your encryption keys but don't want or need to operate your own HSM, consider using AWS CloudHSM.
- [x] **D.** You should consider using AWS CloudHSM over AWS KMS if you require your keys stored in dedicated, third-party validated hardware security modules under your exclusive control.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **D**
> - **D.** You should consider using AWS CloudHSM over AWS KMS if you require your keys stored in dedicated, third-party validated hardware security modules under your exclusive control.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS)** is a managed service that makes it easy for you to create and control the encryption keys used to encrypt your data. The master keys that you create in AWS KMS are protected by FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules. AWS KMS is integrated with most other AWS services that encrypt your data with encryption keys that you manage. AWS KMS is also integrated with AWS CloudTrail to provide encryption key usage logs to help meet your auditing, regulatory and compliance needs.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/encrypt-with-data-key.png)

By using AWS KMS, you gain more control over access to data you encrypt. You can use the key management and cryptographic features directly in your applications or through AWS services that are integrated with AWS KMS. Whether you are writing applications for AWS or using AWS services, AWS KMS enables you to maintain control over who can use your customer master keys and gain access to your encrypted data. AWS KMS is integrated with AWS CloudTrail, a service that delivers log files to an Amazon S3 bucket that you designate. By using CloudTrail, you can monitor and investigate how and when your master keys have been used and by whom.

If you want a managed service for creating and controlling your encryption keys, but you don’t want or need to operate your own HSM, consider using AWS Key Management Service.

Hence, the correct answer is: **You should consider using AWS CloudHSM over AWS KMS if you require your keys stored in dedicated, third-party validated hardware security modules under your exclusive control.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **No major difference. They both do the same thing** is incorrect because KMS and CloudHSM are two different services. If you want a managed service for creating and controlling your encryption keys without operating your own HSM, you have to consider using AWS Key Management Service.

- The option that says: **If you want a managed service for creating and controlling your encryption keys, but you don’t want or need to operate your own HSM, consider using AWS CloudHSM** is incorrect because you have to consider using AWS KMS if you want a managed service for creating and controlling your encryption keys, without operating your own HSM.

- The option that says: **AWS CloudHSM should always be used for any payment transactions** is incorrect because this is not always the case. AWS CloudHSM is a cloud-based hardware security module (HSM) that enables you to easily generate and use your own encryption keys on the AWS Cloud.

### Đề bài (Question)
A disaster recovery team is planning to back up on-premises records to a local file server share through SMB protocol. To meet the company’s business continuity plan, the team must ensure that a copy of data from 48 hours ago is available for immediate access. Accessing older records with delay is tolerable.

Which should the DR team implement to meet the objective with the LEAST amount of configuration effort?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Create an SMB file share in Amazon FSx for Windows File Server that has enough storage to store all backups. Access the file share from on-premises.
- [x] **B.** Use an AWS Storage File gateway with enough storage to keep data from the last 48 hours. Send the backups to an SMB share mounted as a local disk.
- [ ] **C.** Create an AWS Backup plan to copy data backups to a local SMB share every 48 hours.
- [ ] **D.** Mount an Amazon EFS file system on the on-premises client and copy all backups to an NFS share.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **B**
> - **B.** Use an AWS Storage File gateway with enough storage to keep data from the last 48 hours. Send the backups to an SMB share mounted as a local disk.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**Amazon S3 File Gateway** presents a file interface that enables you to store files as objects in Amazon S3 using the industry-standard NFS and SMB file protocols, and access those files via NFS and SMB from your data center or Amazon EC2, or access those files as objects directly in Amazon S3.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/How-File-Gateway-handles-writes.png)

When you deploy File Gateway, you specify how much disk space you want to allocate for local cache. This local cache acts as a buffer for writes and provides low latency access to data that was recently written to or read from Amazon S3. When a client writes data to a file via File Gateway, that data is first written to the local cache disk on the gateway itself. Once the data has been safely persisted to the local cache, only then does the File Gateway acknowledge the write back to the client. From there, File Gateway transfers the data to the S3 bucket asynchronously in the background, optimizing data transfer using multipart parallel uploads and encrypting data in transit using HTTPS.

In this scenario, you can deploy an AWS Storage File Gateway to the on-premises client. After activating the File Gateway, create an SMB share and mount it as a local disk at the on-premises end. Copy the backups to the SMB share. You must ensure that you size the File Gateway’s local cache appropriately to the backup data that needs immediate access. After the backup is done, you will be able to access the older data but with a delay. There will be a small delay since data (not in cache) needs to be retrieved from Amazon S3.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Use an AWS Storage File gateway with enough storage to keep data from the last 48 hours. Send the backups to an SMB share mounted as a local disk.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Create an SMB file share in Amazon FSx for Windows File Server that has enough storage to store all backups. Access the file share from on-premises** is incorrect because this requires additional setup. You need to set up a Direct Connect or VPN connection from on-premises to AWS first in order for this to work.

- The option that says: **Mount an Amazon EFS file system on the on-premises client and copy all backups to an NFS share** is incorrect because the file share required in the scenario needs to be using the SMB protocol.

- The option that says: **Create an AWS Backup plan to copy data backups to a local SMB share every 48 hours** is incorrect. AWS Backup only works on AWS resources.

### Đề bài (Question)
A company deployed a fleet of Windows-based EC2 instances with IPv4 addresses launched in a private subnet. Several software installed in the EC2 instances are required to be updated via the Internet.

Which of the following services can provide the firm a highly available solution to safely allow the instances to fetch the software patches from the Internet but prevent outside network from initiating a connection?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Egress-Only Internet Gateway
- [ ] **B.** NAT Instance
- [x] **C.** NAT Gateway
- [ ] **D.** VPC Endpoint

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **C**
> - **C.** NAT Gateway

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
AWS offers two kinds of NAT devices — a NAT gateway or a NAT instance. It is recommended to use NAT gateways, as they provide better availability and bandwidth over NAT instances. The NAT Gateway service is also a managed service that does not require your administration efforts. A NAT instance is launched from a NAT AMI.

Just like a NAT instance, you can use a network address translation (NAT) gateway to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services but prevent the internet from initiating a connection with those instances.

Here is a diagram showing the differences between NAT gateway and NAT instance:

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/Natcomparison.jpg)

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- **Egress-Only Internet Gateway** is incorrect because this is primarily used for VPCs that use IPv6 to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the Internet or other AWS services but prevent the Internet from initiating a connection with those instances, just like what NAT Instance and NAT Gateway do. The scenario explicitly says that the EC2 instances are using IPv4 addresses which is why Egress-only Internet gateway is invalid, even though it can provide the required high availability.

- **VPC Endpoint** is incorrect because this simply enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an Internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.

- **NAT Instance** is incorrect. Although this can also enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the Internet or other AWS services and prevent the Internet from initiating a connection with those instances, it is not as highly available compared to a NAT Gateway.

### Đề bài (Question)
A company plans to use a cloud storage service to temporarily store its log files. The number of files to be stored is still unknown, but it only needs to be kept for 12 hours.

Which of the following is the most cost-effective storage class to use in this scenario?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Amazon S3 One Zone-IA
- [x] **B.** Amazon S3 Standard
- [ ] **C.** Amazon S3 Standard-IA
- [ ] **D.** Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **B**
> - **B.** Amazon S3 Standard

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3)** is an object storage service that offers industry-leading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. Amazon S3 also offers a range of storage classes for the objects that you store. You choose a class depending on your use case scenario and performance access requirements. All of these storage classes offer high durability.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/amazon-s3-minimum-duration-charge-chart.JPG)

The scenario requires you to select a cost-effective service that does not have a **minimum storage duration** since the data will only last for 12 hours. Among the options given, only Amazon S3 Standard has the feature of no minimum storage duration. It is also the most cost-effective storage service because you will only be charged for the last 12 hours, unlike in other storage classes where you will still be charged based on its respective storage duration (e.g. 30 days, 90 days, 180 days). S3 Intelligent-Tiering also has no minimum storage duration and this is designed for data with changing or unknown access patters.

S3 Standard-IA is designed for long-lived but infrequently accessed data that is retained for months or years. Data that is deleted from S3 Standard-IA within 30 days will still be charged for a full 30 days.

S3 Glacier Deep Archive is designed for long-lived but rarely accessed data that is retained for 7-10 years or more. Objects that are archived to S3 Glacier Deep Archive have a minimum of 180 days of storage, and objects deleted before 180 days incur a pro-rated charge equal to the storage charge for the remaining days.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Amazon S3 Standard** .

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- **Amazon S3 Standard-IA** is incorrect because this storage class has a minimum storage duration of at least 30 days. Remember that the scenario requires the data to be kept for 12 hours only.

- **Amazon S3 One Zone-IA** is incorrect. Just like S3 Standard-IA, this storage class has a minimum storage duration of at least 30 days.

- **Amazon S3 Glacier Deep Archive** is incorrect. Although it is the most cost-effective storage class among all other options, it has a minimum storage duration of at least 180 days which is only suitable for backup and data archival. If you store your data in Glacier Deep Archive for only 12 hours, you will still be charged for the full 180 days.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
Enhanced networking uses single root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) to provide high-performance networking capabilities on supported instance types. SR-IOV is a method of device virtualization that provides higher I/O performance and lower CPU utilization when compared to traditional virtualized network interfaces. Enhanced networking provides higher bandwidth, higher packet per second (PPS) performance, and consistently lower inter-instance latencies. There is no additional charge for using enhanced networking.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/image11.png)

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **When you need a low packet-per-second performance** is incorrect because you want to increase packet-per-second performance and not lower it when you enable enhanced networking.

- The option that says: **When you need high latency networking** is incorrect because higher latencies mean a slower network, which is the opposite of what you want to happen when you enable enhanced networking.

- The option that says: **When you need a dedicated connection to your on-premises data center** is incorrect because enabling enhanced networking does not provide a dedicated connection to your on-premises data center. Use AWS Direct Connect or enable VPN tunneling instead for this purpose.

### Đề bài (Question)
A startup is building a microservices architecture in which the software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. In building large-scale systems, fine-grained decoupling of microservices is a recommended practice to implement. The decoupled services should scale horizontally from each other to improve scalability.

What is the difference between Horizontal scaling and Vertical scaling?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Horizontal scaling means running the same software on bigger machines which is limited by the capacity of individual servers. Vertical scaling is adding more servers to the existing pool and doesn’t run into limitations of individual servers.
- [ ] **B.** Horizontal scaling means running the same software on smaller containers such as Docker and Kubernetes using ECS or EKS. Vertical scaling is adding more servers to the existing pool and doesn’t run into limitations of individual servers.
- [x] **C.** Vertical scaling means running the same software on bigger machines which is limited by the capacity of the individual server. Horizontal scaling is adding more servers to the existing pool and doesn’t run into limitations of individual servers.
- [ ] **D.** Vertical scaling means running the same software on a fully serverless architecture using Lambda. Horizontal scaling means adding more servers to the existing pool and it doesn’t run into limitations of individual servers.

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
Vertical scaling means running the same software on bigger machines which is limited by the capacity of the individual server. Horizontal scaling is adding more servers to the existing pool and doesn’t run into limitations of individual servers.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/2018-12-10_10-50-47-8b7b5c45cd789db9c3d60d111ad22276.png)

Fine-grained decoupling of microservices is a best practice for building large-scale systems. It’s a prerequisite for performance optimization since it allows choosing the appropriate and optimal technologies for a specific service. Each service can be implemented with the appropriate programming languages and frameworks, leverage the optimal data persistence solution, and be fine-tuned with the best-performing service configurations.

Properly decoupled services can be scaled horizontally and independently from each other. Vertical scaling, which is running the same software on bigger machines, is limited by the capacity of individual servers and can incur downtime during the scaling process. Horizontal scaling, which is adding more servers to the existing pool, is highly dynamic and doesn’t run into limitations of individual servers. The scaling process can be completely automated.

Furthermore, the resiliency of the application can be improved because failing components can be easily and automatically replaced. Hence, the correct answer is the option that says: **Vertical scaling means running the same software on bigger machines which is limited by the capacity of the individual server. Horizontal scaling is adding more servers to the existing pool and doesn’t run into limitations of individual servers.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Vertical scaling means running the same software on a fully serverless architecture using Lambda. Horizontal scaling means adding more servers to the existing pool and it doesn’t run into limitations of individual servers** is incorrect because Vertical scaling is not about running the same software on a fully serverless architecture. AWS Lambda is not required for scaling.

- The option that says: **Horizontal scaling means running the same software on bigger machines which is limited by the capacity of individual servers. Vertical scaling is adding more servers to the existing pool and doesn’t run into limitations of individual servers** is incorrect because the definitions for the two concepts were switched. Vertical scaling means running the same software on bigger machines which is limited by the capacity of the individual server. Horizontal scaling is adding more servers to the existing pool and doesn’t run into limitations of individual servers.

- The option that says: **Horizontal scaling means running the same software on smaller containers such as Docker and Kubernetes using ECS or EKS. Vertical scaling is adding more servers to the existing pool and doesn’t run into limitations of individual servers** is incorrect because Horizontal scaling is not related to using ECS or EKS containers on a smaller instance.

In this scenario, which VPC feature will allow the EC2 instance to communicate to the Internet but prevents inbound IPv6 traffic?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** NAT Gateway
- [ ] **B.** NAT instances
- [ ] **C.** Internet Gateway
- [x] **D.** Egress-only Internet gateway

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **D**
> - **D.** Egress-only Internet gateway

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
An **egress-only Internet gateway** is a horizontally scaled, redundant, and highly available VPC component that allows outbound communication over IPv6 from instances in your VPC to the Internet, and prevents the Internet from initiating an IPv6 connection with your instances.

Take note that an egress-only Internet gateway is for use with IPv6 traffic only. To enable outbound-only Internet communication over IPv4, use a NAT gateway instead.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/egress-only-gateway-saa-c02-aws.png)

![](../)

Hence, the correct answer is: **Egress-only Internet gateway.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- **NAT Gateway** **and** **NAT instances** are incorrect. Although NAT64, a feature that enables the communication between IPv6 and IPv4 hosts, may be supported by these components, they are unable to block inbound IPv6 traffic. Both NAT 64 and egress-only gateways can be used to enable outbound Internet connectivity, for instances in a VPC, but they differ in their support for inbound traffic and their handling of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. The most suitable VPC component to use is the scenario is the egress-only Internet gateway.

- **Internet Gateway** is incorrect because this is primarily used to provide Internet access to your instances in the public subnet of your VPC and not for private subnets. However, with an Internet gateway, traffic originating from the public Internet will also be able to reach your instances. The scenario is asking you to prevent inbound access, so this is not the correct answer.

### Đề bài (Question)
A company has a VPC for its Human Resource department and another VPC located in different AWS regions for its Finance department. The Solutions Architect must redesign the architecture to allow the finance department to access all resources that are in the human resource department, and vice versa. An Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) must also be integrated for active traffic flow inspection and to block any vulnerability exploits.

Which network architecture design in AWS should the Solutions Architect set up to satisfy the above requirement?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [x] **A.** Launch an AWS Transit Gateway and add VPC attachments to connect all departments. Set up AWS Network Firewall to secure the application traffic travelling between the VPCs.
- [ ] **B.** Create a Traffic Policy in Amazon Route 53 to connect the two VPCs. Configure the Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall to do active traffic flow inspection and block any vulnerability exploits.
- [ ] **C.** Establish a secure connection between the two VPCs using a NAT Gateway. Manage user sessions via the AWS Systems Manager Session Manager service.
- [ ] **D.** Create a Direct Connect Gateway and add VPC attachments to connect all departments. Configure AWS Security Hub to secure the application traffic travelling between the VPCs.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **A**
> - **A.** Launch an AWS Transit Gateway and add VPC attachments to connect all departments. Set up AWS Network Firewall to secure the application traffic travelling between the VPCs.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
A *transit gateway* is a network transit hub that you can use to interconnect your virtual private clouds (VPCs) and on-premises networks. As your cloud infrastructure expands globally, inter-Region peering connects transit gateways together using the AWS Global Infrastructure. Your data is automatically encrypted and never travels over the public internet.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/aws-transit-gateway-mesh-aec3.png)

A transit gateway attachment is both a source and a destination of packets. You can attach the following resources to your transit gateway:

– One or more VPCs.

– One or more VPN connections

– One or more AWS Direct Connect gateways

– One or more Transit Gateway Connect attachments

– One or more transit gateway peering connections

AWS Transit Gateway deploys an elastic network interface within VPC subnets, which is then used by the transit gateway to route traffic to and from the chosen subnets. You must have at least one subnet for each Availability Zone, which then enables traffic to reach resources in every subnet of that zone. During attachment creation, resources within a particular Availability Zone can reach a transit gateway only if a subnet is enabled within the same zone. If a subnet route table includes a route to the transit gateway, traffic is only forwarded to the transit gateway if the transit gateway has an attachment in the subnet of the same Availability Zone.

Intra-region peering connections are supported. You can have different transit gateways in different Regions.

AWS Network Firewall is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy essential network protections for all of your Amazon Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs). The service can be setup with just a few clicks and scales automatically with your network traffic, so you don’t have to worry about deploying and managing any infrastructure. AWS Network Firewall’s flexible rules engine lets you define firewall rules that give you fine-grained control over network traffic, such as blocking outbound Server Message Block (SMB) requests to prevent the spread of malicious activity.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/aws-network-firewall-diagram.png)

AWS Network Firewall includes features that provide protections from common network threats. AWS Network Firewall’s stateful firewall can incorporate context from traffic flows, like tracking connections and protocol identification, to enforce policies such as preventing your VPCs from accessing domains using an unauthorized protocol. AWS Network Firewall’s intrusion prevention system (IPS) provides active traffic flow inspection so you can identify and block vulnerability exploits using signature-based detection. AWS Network Firewall also offers web filtering that can stop traffic to known bad URLs and monitor fully qualified domain names.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Launch a Transit Gateway and add VPC attachments to connect all departments. Set up AWS Network Firewall to secure the application traffic travelling between the VPCs.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Create a Traffic Policy in Amazon Route 53 to connect the two VPCs. Configure the Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall to do active traffic flow inspection and block any vulnerability exploits** is incorrect because the Traffic Policy feature is commonly used in tandem with the geoproximity routing policy for creating and maintaining records in large and complex configurations. Moreover, the Route 53 Resolver DNS Firewall can only filter and regulate outbound DNS traffic for your virtual private cloud (VPC). It can neither do active traffic flow inspection nor block any vulnerability exploits.

- The option that says: **Establish a secure connection between the two VPCs using a NAT Gateway. Manage user sessions via the AWS Systems Manager Session Manager service** is incorrect because a NAT Gateway is simply a Network Address Translation (NAT) service and can’t be used to connect two VPCs in different AWS regions. This service allows your instances in a private subnet to connect to services outside your VPC but external services cannot initiate a connection with those instances. Furthermore, the AWS Systems Manager Session Manager service is meant for managing EC2 instances via remote SSH or PowerShell access. This is not used for managing user sessions.

- The option that says: **Create a Direct Connect Gateway and add VPC attachments to connect all departments. Configure AWS Security Hub to secure the application traffic travelling between the VPCs** is incorrect. An AWS Direct Connect gateway is meant to be used in conjuction with an AWS Direct Connect connection to your on-premises network to connect with a Transit Gateway or a Virtual Private Gateway. You still need a Transit Gateway to connect the two VPCs that are in different AWS Regions. The AWS Security Hub is simply a cloud security posture management service that automates best practice checks, aggregates alerts, and supports automated remediation. It’s important to note that it doesn’t secure application traffic just by itself.

### Đề bài (Question)
A top university has recently launched its online learning portal where the students can take e-learning courses from the comforts of their homes. The portal is on a large On-Demand EC2 instance with a single Amazon Aurora database.

How can you improve the availability of your Aurora database to prevent any unnecessary downtime of the online portal?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Use an Asynchronous Key Prefetch in Amazon Aurora to improve the performance of queries that join tables across indexes.
- [ ] **B.** Deploy Aurora to two Auto-Scaling groups of EC2 instances across two Availability Zones with an elastic load balancer which handles load balancing.
- [x] **C.** Create Amazon Aurora Replicas.
- [ ] **D.** Enable Hash Joins to improve the database query performance.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **C**
> - **C.** Create Amazon Aurora Replicas.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**Amazon Aurora MySQL** and **Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL** support Amazon Aurora Replicas, which share the same underlying volume as the primary instance. Updates made by the primary are visible to all Amazon Aurora Replicas. With Amazon Aurora MySQL, you can also create MySQL Read Replicas based on MySQL’s binlog-based replication engine. In MySQL Read Replicas, data from your primary instance is replayed on your replica as transactions. For most use cases, including read scaling and high availability, it is recommended to use Amazon Aurora Replicas.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/Aurora-Arch.jpg)

Read Replicas are primarily used for improving the read performance of the application. The most suitable solution in this scenario is to use Multi-AZ deployments instead, but since this option is not available, you can still set up Read Replicas which you can promote as your primary stand-alone DB cluster in the event of an outage.

Hence, the correct answer here is to **create Amazon Aurora Replicas** .

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- **Deploying Aurora to two Auto-Scaling groups of EC2 instances across two Availability Zones with an elastic load balancer which handles load balancing** is incorrect because Aurora is a managed database engine for RDS and not deployed on typical EC2 instances that you manually provision.

- **Enabling Hash Joins to improve the database query performance** is incorrect because Hash Joins are mainly used if you need to join a large amount of data by using an equijoin and not for improving availability.

- **Using an Asynchronous Key Prefetch in Amazon Aurora to improve the performance of queries that join tables across indexes** is incorrect because the Asynchronous Key Prefetch is mainly used to improve the performance of queries that join tables across indexes.

### Đề bài (Question)
A company is looking for a way to analyze the calls between customers and service agents. Each conversation is transcribed, JSON-formatted, and saved to an Amazon S3 bucket. The company’s solutions architect is tasked to design a solution for extracting and visualizing sentiments from the transcribed files.

Which solution meets the requirements while minimizing the amount of operational overhead?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Create an Amazon Comprehend analysis job. Index the sentiment along with the transcript to an Amazon OpenSearch cluster. Visualize the results using Amazon Managed Grafana.
- [ ] **B.** Analyze the JSON files with Amazon Textract. Index the sentiment along with the transcript to an Amazon OpenSearch cluster. Visualize the results using Amazon Managed Grafana.
- [ ] **C.** Train a custom Natural Language Processing (NLP) model using Amazon SageMaker. Index the sentiment along with the transcript to an Amazon OpenSearch cluster. Visualize the results using the OpenSearch Dashboard.
- [x] **D.** Create an Amazon Comprehend analysis job. Index the sentiment along with the transcript to an Amazon OpenSearch cluster. Visualize the results using the OpenSearch Dashboard.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **D**
> - **D.** Create an Amazon Comprehend analysis job. Index the sentiment along with the transcript to an Amazon OpenSearch cluster. Visualize the results using the OpenSearch Dashboard.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**Amazon Comprehend** uses machine learning to help you uncover the insights and relationships in your unstructured data. The service identifies the language of the text; extracts key phrases, places, people, brands, or events; understands how positive or negative the text is; analyzes text using tokenization and parts of speech, and automatically organizes a collection of text files by topic. You can also use AutoML capabilities in Amazon Comprehend to build a custom set of entities or text classification models that are tailored uniquely to your organization’s needs.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/text-analysis-with-amazon-opensearch-service-and-amazon-comprehend-architecture.png)

In this scenario, you can build the application with the help of Amazon Comprehend. You could expose the application through a RESTful endpoint, have it invoke a Lambda function that will call Amazon Comprehend for sentiment analysis, and index data into an Amazon OpenSearch cluster.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Create an Amazon Comprehend analysis job. Index the sentiment along with the transcript to an Amazon OpenSearch cluster. Visualize the results using the OpenSearch Dashboard.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Analyze the JSON files with Amazon Textract. Index the sentiment along with the transcript to an Amazon OpenSearch cluster. Visualize the results using Amazon Managed Grafana** is incorrect. Amazon Textract is just an AI service used to extract text data from scanned documents in PNG, JPEG, TIFF, PDF formats and is not capable of running sentiment analysis. Furthermore, Grafana is more suited for the visualization of time-series data such as system metrics (CPU load, disk storage, memory utilization, temperature, etc). While there are hacks you can use to visualize non-time series like the one in the scenario, they come with additional overhead on your part. The built-in OpenSearch dashboard is enough to do the job.

- The option that says: **Create an Amazon Comprehend analysis job. Index the sentiment along with the transcript to an Amazon OpenSearch cluster. Visualize the results using Amazon Managed Grafana** is incorrect. The Amazon OpenSearch dashboard is a more suitable service to use than Grafana since the sentiment data is already processed by an Amazon OpenSearch cluster. This solution needs a separate AWS data source configuration in the Grafana workspace console to integrate and read the sentiment data, which entails an additional operational overhead.

- The option that says: **Train a custom Natural Language Processing (NLP) model using Amazon SageMaker. Index the sentiment along with the transcript to an Amazon OpenSearch cluster. Visualize the results using the Amazon QuickSight Dashboard** is incorrect. Although this may be a viable option, training your own ML model rather than using the readily available Amazon Comprehend service requires more time and effort. The same is true in using the Amazon QuickSight dashboard instead of the OpenSearch Dashboard. It takes a lot of steps to properly integrate Amazon QuickSight and an OpenSearch cluster which might cause delays in the project implementation.

### Đề bài (Question)
A Solutions Architect needs to set up the required compute resources for the application which have workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage.

Which of the following instance type is the most suitable one to use in this scenario?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Compute Optimized Instances
- [ ] **B.** Memory Optimized Instances
- [x] **C.** Storage Optimized Instances
- [ ] **D.** General Purpose Instances

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **C**
> - **C.** Storage Optimized Instances

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**Storage optimized instances** are designed for workloads that require high, sequential read and write access to very large data sets on local storage. They are optimized to deliver tens of thousands of low-latency, random I/O operations per second (IOPS) to applications.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/AWS-Instance-Types.png)

Hence, the correct answer is: **Storage Optimized Instances.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- **Memory Optimized Instances** is incorrect because these are designed to deliver fast performance for workloads that process large data sets in memory, which is quite different from handling high read and write capacity on local storage.

- **Compute Optimized Instances** is incorrect because these are ideal for compute-bound applications that benefit from high-performance processors, such as batch processing workloads and media transcoding.

- **General Purpose Instances** is incorrect because these are the most basic type of instances. They provide a balance of compute, memory, and networking resources, and can be used for a variety of workloads. Since you are requiring higher read and write capacity, storage optimized instances should be selected instead.

> **Đáp án đúng:** **A, B**
> - **A.** Provides enhanced database durability in the event of a DB instance component failure or an Availability Zone outage.
> - **B.** Increased database availability in the case of system upgrades like OS patching or DB Instance scaling.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments** provide enhanced availability and durability for Database (DB) Instances, making them a natural fit for production database workloads. When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ). Each AZ runs on its own physically distinct, independent infrastructure and is engineered to be highly reliable.

In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete. Since the endpoint for your DB Instance remains the same after a failover, your application can resume database operation without the need for manual administrative intervention.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/con-multi-AZ.png)

The chief benefits of running your DB instance as a Multi-AZ deployment are enhanced database durability and availability. The increased availability and fault tolerance offered by Multi-AZ deployments make them a natural fit for production environments.

Hence, the correct answers are the following options:

 **– Increased database availability in the case of system upgrades like OS patching or DB Instance scaling.**

 **– Provides enhanced database durability in the event of a DB instance component failure or an Availability Zone outage.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ) in a different region** is incorrect. RDS synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ) that is in the same region and not in a different one.

- The options that say: **Significantly increases the database performance** **and** **Provides SQL optimization** are incorrect as it does not affect the performance nor provide SQL optimization.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**AWS Auto Scaling** monitors your applications and automatically adjusts capacity to maintain steady, predictable performance at the lowest possible cost. Using AWS Auto Scaling, it’s easy to set up application scaling for multiple resources across multiple services in minutes. The service provides a simple, powerful user interface that lets you build scaling plans for resources, including Amazon EC2 instances and Spot Fleets, Amazon ECS tasks, Amazon DynamoDB tables and indexes, and Amazon Aurora Replicas.

In this scenario, you can set up a scaling policy that triggers a scale-out activity to an ECS service or ECS container instance based on the metric that you prefer.

 **The following metrics are available for instances:**

-CPU Utilization

-Disk Reads

-Disk Read Operations

-Disk Writes

-Disk Write Operations

-Network In

-Network Out

-Status Check Failed (Any)

-Status Check Failed (Instance)

-Status Check Failed (System)

 **The following metrics are available for ECS Service:**

 **-ECSServiceAverageCPUUtilization** —Average CPU utilization of the service.

 **-ECSServiceAverageMemoryUtilization** —Average memory utilization of the service.

 **-ALBRequestCountPerTarget** —Number of requests completed per target in an Application Load Balancer target group.

Hence, the correct answers are:

 **– Create an AWS Auto scaling policy that scales out the ECS service when the service’s memory utilization is too high.**

 **– Create an AWS Auto scaling policy that scales out the ECS cluster when the service’s CPU utilization is too high.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Create an AWS Auto scaling policy that scales out an ECS service when the ALB endpoint becomes unreachable** is incorrect. This would be a different problem that needs to be addressed differently if this is the case. An unreachable ALB endpoint could mean other things like a misconfigured security group or network access control lists.

- The option that says: **Create an AWS Auto scaling policy that scales out the ECS service when the ALB hits a high CPU utilization** is incorrect. You cannot track nor view the CPU utilization of an ALB.

- The option that says: **Create an AWS Auto scaling policy that scales out the ECS cluster when the ALB target group’s CPU utilization is too high** is incorrect. AWS Auto Scaling does not support this metric for ALB.

### Đề bài (Question)
A commercial bank has designed its next-generation online banking platform to use a distributed system architecture. The Solutions Architect was tasked to ensure that the architecture is highly scalable, cost-effective, and leverages Amazon EC2 for compute resources.

Which of the following will provide the most suitable solution for this scenario?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Launch multiple EC2 instances and use Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic across the instances, which will host application services, while Amazon SNS will act as a highly-scalable buffer for messages as they travel between distributed applications.
- [x] **B.** Launch an Auto-Scaling group of EC2 instances to host your application services and an Amazon SQS queue. Include an Auto Scaling trigger to watch the SQS queue size which will either scale in or scale out the number of EC2 instances based on the queue.
- [ ] **C.** Launch multiple EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer to host your application services, and an AWS Step Functions workflow which will act as a highly scalable buffer that stores messages as they travel between distributed applications.
- [ ] **D.** Launch multiple On-Demand EC2 instances to host your application services and an Amazon SQS queue which will act as a highly-scalable buffer that stores messages as they travel between distributed applications.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **B**
> - **B.** Launch an Auto-Scaling group of EC2 instances to host your application services and an Amazon SQS queue. Include an Auto Scaling trigger to watch the SQS queue size which will either scale in or scale out the number of EC2 instances based on the queue.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
An Auto Scaling group allows you to maintain the health and availability of your application by scaling the number of EC2 instances up or down based on demand. This is particularly useful in a banking platform where traffic can be highly variable. The group can scale out (add more instances) during high-demand periods and scale in (remove instances) during low demand periods, ensuring optimal resource utilization and cost-effectiveness.

To improve the scalability of your distributed system, you can add an Auto Scaling group to your EC2 instances.

![Setting up auto scaling group](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/auto-scaling-group-121523.png)

Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. In the context of a banking platform, SQS can act as a buffer for messages as they travel between distributed applications, ensuring that no message is lost and that the order of transactions is maintained.

There are three main parts in a distributed messaging system: the components of your distributed system, which can be hosted on EC2 instance; your queue (distributed on Amazon SQS servers); and the messages in the queue.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Launch an Auto-Scaling group of EC2 instances to host your application services and an Amazon SQS queue. Include an Auto Scaling trigger to watch the SQS queue size which will either scale in or scale out the number of EC2 instances based on the queue.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Launch multiple EC2 instances and use Elastic Load Balancing to distribute traffic across the instances, which will host application services, while Amazon SNS will act as a highly-scalable buffer for messages as they travel between distributed applications** is incorrect because SNS is typically designed for pub/sub messaging and mobile notifications, which is not ideal for use cases where data consistency and transaction integrity are critical, such as in a banking platform. For reliable message queuing and to trigger scaling based on demand, SQS would be a more appropriate solution.

- The option that says: **Launch multiple EC2 instances behind an Application Load Balancer to host your application services, and an AWS Step Functions workflow which will act as a highly scalable buffer that stores messages as they travel between distributed applications** is incorrect because Step Functions is primarily designed for orchestrating complex workflows and business processes, rather than acting as a buffer for messages. For a banking platform, a more suitable service might be one that provides reliable message queuing and delivery, such as Amazon SQS.

- The option that says: **Launch multiple On-Demand EC2 instances to host your application services and an Amazon SQS queue which will act as a highly-scalable buffer that stores messages as they travel between distributed applications** is incorrect because On-Demand EC2 instances are expensive and might not be the most cost-effective solution for a banking platform that needs to be highly scalable. SQS is a good choice for buffering messages between distributed applications, but the cost of running multiple On-Demand EC2 instances might only outweigh the benefits.

## Câu 61 (Chọn 1 đáp án (Single Choice))
**Domain:** *CSAA – Design Secure Architectures*

### Đề bài (Question)
A company is designing a customized text messaging service that targets its mobile app users. As part of its multi-engagement marketing campaign, a company needs to send a one-time confirmation message to all of its subscribers using Short Message Service (SMS). The solutions architect must design the system to allow a subscriber to reply to the SMS messages.

The customer responses must be kept for an entire year for analysis and targeted sales promotions. In addition, the SMS responses must also be collected, processed, and analyzed in near-real-time.

Which solution will meet these requirements with the LEAST operational overhead?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Set up an Amazon Connect contact flow to send the confirmation SMS messages to the mobile app users. Deploy an AWS Lambda function to process and analyze the responses. Store the data in Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval.
- [ ] **B.** Create a new topic in Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) and an Amazon Kinesis data stream configured with all its default settings. Send SMS messages using SNS. Integrate the Kinesis data stream to the SNS topic for data collection, archiving, and analysis.
- [ ] **C.** Launch a new Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue to send out SMS messages. Use AWS Step Functions and AWS Lambda to collect, process, and analyze responses. Store the data in Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval.
- [x] **D.** Configure AWS End User Messaging SMS to send confirmation messages using a two-way SMS-enabled phone number. Route incoming subscriber responses to an Amazon SNS topic and use AWS Lambda to process and forward the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for near-real-time analytics. Configure the Kinesis data stream with a retention period of 365 days.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
AWS End User Messaging SMS is an application-to-person (A2P) messaging service that supports SMS, MMS, RCS, and voice communications. It offers global scalability, resilience, and flexibility, making it suitable for delivering messages across web, mobile, and business applications. SMS is widely used for critical and time-sensitive communications, as it is the most effective and universally accessible channel available.

Customers often focus on essential use cases, such as one-time password (OTP) logins and authentications, marketing messages, citizen outreach, delivery status updates, and appointment reminders.

![AWS End User Messaging](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/AWS End User Messaging-13OCT2026.png)

AWS End User Messaging SMS also supports two-way SMS, allowing you to receive incoming messages from your customers. You can integrate two-way messaging with other AWS services like Lambda and Amazon Lex to create interactive text messaging experiences. When a customer sends a message to your designated phone number, the message is forwarded to an Amazon SNS topic or Connect Customer for further processing.

Additionally, Amazon Kinesis Data Streams allows for adjustments to the data record retention period for your data stream. A Kinesis data stream is an ordered sequence of data records that is designed for real-time writing and reading. These records are temporarily stored in shards within your stream. The retention period refers to the time duration a record remains accessible after being added. By default, Kinesis data streams retain records for 24 hours, with an option to extend this period up to 8,760 hours (or 365 days).

Hence, the correct answer is: **Configure AWS End User Messaging SMS to send confirmation messages using a two-way SMS-enabled phone number. Route incoming subscriber responses to an Amazon SNS topic and use AWS Lambda to process and forward the messages to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for near-real-time analytics. Configure the Kinesis data stream with a retention period of 365 days.** AWS End User Messaging SMS supports two-way SMS messaging, allowing subscribers to reply to messages. Incoming SMS responses can be routed directly to an Amazon SNS topic for processing. AWS Lambda can process the responses and send them to Amazon Kinesis Data Streams for near-real-time analytics. This architecture is largely serverless and managed, resulting in minimal operational overhead while meeting all the requirements.

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Create a new topic in Amazon Simple Notification Service (Amazon SNS) and an Amazon Kinesis data stream configured with all its default settings. Send SMS messages using SNS. Integrate the Kinesis data stream to the SNS topic for data collection, archiving, and analysis** is incorrect because Amazon SNS can send SMS messages, but it does not primarily provide the required two-way SMS solution where subscriber replies are received and processed. The question specifically requires subscribers to reply to the SMS messages. AWS End User Messaging SMS provides native two-way SMS capabilities and can route incoming messages to an SNS topic for processing.

- The option that says: **Launch a new Amazon Simple Queue Service (Amazon SQS) queue to send out SMS messages. Use AWS Step Functions and AWS Lambda to collect, process, and analyze responses. Store the data in Amazon S3 Glacier Instant Retrieval** is incorrect because using Amazon SQS alone is not capable of sending out SMS messages. In addition, the SMS marketing campaign is sent only once. It’s better to process and store the responses in an Amazon Kinesis data stream and set its retention period to 1 year.

- The option that says: **Set up an Amazon Connect contact flow to send the confirmation SMS messages to the mobile app users. Deploy an AWS Lambda function to process and analyze the responses. Store the data in Amazon S3 Glacier Flexible Retrieval** is incorrect. Using Amazon Connect to send a one-time SMS marketing campaign entails a lot of operational overhead to launch and maintain. The cost is significantly higher too. Take note that the scenario asks for a solution with the least amount of operational overhead.

### Đề bài (Question)
A Python application running on VMware Cloud on AWS must connect to an Amazon DynamoDB table called `tutorialsdojo`.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
You manage access in AWS by creating policies and attaching them to IAM identities (users, groups of users, or roles) or AWS resources. A policy is an object in AWS that, when associated with an identity or resource, defines its permissions. AWS evaluates these policies when an IAM principal (user or role) makes a request. Permissions in the policies determine whether the request is allowed or denied.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/iam-policy-structure.jpg)

There are various elements that make up an IAM policy statement, the following are required when creating an IAM policy for IAM Identities:

– **Effect** : The effect can be **Allow** or **Deny** . By default, IAM users don’t have permission to use resources and API actions, so all requests are denied. An explicit allow overrides the default. An explicit deny overrides any allows.

– **Action** : The action is the specific API action for which you are granting or denying permission.

– **Resource** : The resource that’s affected by the action. You specify a resource using an Amazon Resource Name (ARN).

IAM supports the “*” wildcard in both the resources and actions attributes, making it easier to automatically select multiple matching items. This grants broad permissions, often for many permissions or resources.

Since the scenario is asking for granular control (read, write, delete) over a particular DynamoDB table, all options containing wildcards must be eliminated.

Hence, the correct answer is:

 **`
{
 "Version": "2012-10-17",
 "Statement": [
 {
 "Effect": "Allow",
 "Action": [
 "dynamodb:PutItem",
 "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
 "dynamodb:GetItem",
 "dynamodb:UpdateItem"
 ],
 "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-2:123456789012:table/tutorialsdojo"
 }
 ]
 }
}`**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The following policy is incorrect because it does not adhere to the principle of least privilege access due to the use of wildcards. Remember that the scenario mentioned that the user should only have the permission to read, write, update and delete an item. Therefore, you have to explicitly mention the specific APIs to allow these operations – GetItem, PutItem, UpdateItem and DeleteItem respectively. If you use the wildcard for Update*, then it will also include other actions that the user is not authorized to invoke such as UpdateContinuousBackups, UpdateContributorInsights, UpdateGlobalTable, UpdateGlobalTableSettings et cetera:

- **`
  {
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [{
   "Effect": "Allow",
   "Action": [
   "dynamodb:Put*",
   "dynamodb:Delete*",
   "dynamodb:Get*",
   "dynamodb:Update*"
   ],
   "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-2:123456789012:table/tutorialsdojo"
   }]
  }
   `**

  The policy below is quite insecure since it is used a DynamoDB wildcard in the “Resource field” of the IAM Policy. The scenario clearly says that you have to allow access to certain operations for the tutorialsdojo table only, and not for all DynamoDB tables in your AWS account. Thus, this policy is incorrect:

- **`
  {
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
   {
   "Effect": "Allow",
   "Action": [
   "dynamodb:PutItem",
   "dynamodb:DeleteItem",
   "dynamodb:GetItem",
   "dynamodb:UpdateItem"
   ],
   "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-2:123456789012:table/*"
   }
   ]
   }
  }`**

- Lastly, the IAM Policy depicted below is not right since you are technically allowing all API operations for the tutorialsdojo DynamoDB table:

- **`
  {
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [{
   "Effect": "Allow",
   "Action": "*",
   "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-2:123456789012:table/tutorialsdojo"
   }]
  }`**

**Domain:** *CSAA – Design Secure Architectures*

### Đề bài (Question)
An application is loading hundreds of JSON documents into an Amazon S3 bucket every hour which is registered in AWS Lake Formation as a data catalog. The Data Analytics team uses Amazon Athena to run analyses on these data, but due to the volume, most queries take a long time to complete.

What change should be made to improve the query performance while ensuring data security?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Apply minification on the data and implement the Lake Formation tag-based access control (LF-TBAC) authorization strategy to ensure security.
- [x] **B.** Transform the JSON data into Apache Parquet format. Ensure that the user has an `lakeformation:GetDataAccess` IAM permission for underlying data access control.
- [ ] **C.** Compress the data into GZIP format before storing it in the S3 bucket. Apply an IAM policy with `aws:SourceArn` and `aws:SourceAccount` global condition context keys in Lake Formation that prevents cross-service confused deputy problems and other security issues.
- [ ] **D.** Convert the JSON documents into CSV format. Provide fine-grained named resource access control to specific databases or tables in AWS Lake Formation.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **B**
> - **B.** Transform the JSON data into Apache Parquet format. Ensure that the user has an `lakeformation:GetDataAccess` IAM permission for underlying data access control.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
**Amazon Athena** supports a wide variety of data formats like CSV, TSV, JSON, or Textfiles and also supports open-source columnar formats such as Apache ORC and Apache Parquet. Athena also supports compressed data in Snappy, Zlib, LZO, and GZIP formats. By compressing, partitioning, and using columnar formats you can improve performance and reduce your costs.

Parquet and ORC file formats both support predicate pushdown (also called predicate filtering). Parquet and ORC both have blocks of data that represent column values. Each block holds statistics for the block, such as max/min values. When a query is being executed, these statistics determine whether the block should be read or skipped.

Athena charges you by the amount of data scanned per query. You can save on costs and get better performance if you partition the data, compress data, or convert it to columnar formats such as Apache Parquet.

![](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/apache parquet vs csv.png)

Apache Parquet is an open-source columnar storage format that is 2x faster to unload and takes up 6x less storage in Amazon S3 as compared to other text formats. One can `COPY` Apache Parquet and Apache ORC file formats from Amazon S3 to your Amazon Redshift cluster. Using AWS Glue, one can configure and run a job to transform CSV data to Parquet. Parquet is a columnar format that is well suited for AWS analytics services like Amazon Athena and Amazon Redshift Spectrum.

When an integrated AWS service requests access to data in an Amazon S3 location that is access-controlled by AWS Lake Formation, Lake Formation supplies temporary credentials to access the data. To enable Lake Formation to control access to underlying data at an Amazon S3 location, you register that location with Lake Formation.

To enable Lake Formation principals to read and write underlying data with access controlled by Lake Formation permissions:

– The Amazon S3 locations that contain the data must be registered with Lake Formation.

– Principals who create Data Catalog tables that point to underlying data locations must have data location permissions.

– Principals who read and write underlying data must have Lake Formation data access permissions on the Data Catalog tables that point to the underlying data locations.

– Principals who read and write underlying data must have the `lakeformation:GetDataAccess` IAM permission.

Thus, the correct answer is: **Transform the JSON data into Apache Parquet format. Ensure that the user has an `lakeformation:GetDataAccess` IAM permission for underlying data access control.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Convert the JSON documents into CSV format. Provide fine-grained named resource access control to specific databases or tables in AWS Lake Formation** is incorrect because Athena queries performed against row-based formats like CSV are slower than columnar file formats like Apache Parquet.

- The option that says: **Apply minification on the data and implement the Lake Formation tag-based access control (LF-TBAC) authorization strategy using IAM Tags to ensure security** is incorrect. Although minifying the JSON file might reduce its overall file size, there won’t be a significant difference in terms of querying performance. LF-TBAC is a type of an attribute-based access control (ABAC) that defines permissions based on certain attributes, such as tags in AWS. LF-TBAC uses LF-Tags to grant Lake Formation permissions and not regular IAM Tags.

- The option that says: **Compress the data into GZIP format before storing in the S3 bucket. Apply an IAM policy with `aws:SourceArn` and `aws:SourceAccount` global condition context keys in Lake Formation that prevents cross-service confused deputy problems and other security issues.** is incorrect. Compressing the files prior to storing them in Amazon S3 will only save storage costs. As for query performance, it won’t have much improvement. In addition, using an IAM Policy to prevent cross-service confused deputy issues is not warranted in this scenario. Having an `lakeformation:GetDataAccess` IAM permission for underlying data access control should suffice.

## Câu 64 (Chọn 1 đáp án (Single Choice))
**Domain:** *CSAA – Design High-Performing Architectures*

### Đề bài (Question)
A computer animation film studio runs a web application on an Amazon EC2 instance. It uploads 5 GB video objects to an Amazon S3 bucket. Video uploads take longer than expected, impacting the application’s performance.

Which method will help improve the performance of the application?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [ ] **A.** Leverage on Amazon CloudFront and use HTTP POST method to reduce latency.
- [x] **B.** Use S3 Multipart Upload API.
- [ ] **C.** Enable Enhanced Networking with the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) on your EC2 Instances.
- [ ] **D.** Use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Provisioned IOPS volumes in a Logical Volume Management (LVM) stripe configuration on an EBS-optimized instance to maximize throughput.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **B**
> - **B.** Use S3 Multipart Upload API.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
The main issue is the slow upload time of the video objects to Amazon S3. To address this issue, you can use Multipart upload in S3 to improve the throughput. It allows you to upload parts of your object in parallel thus, decreasing the time it takes to upload big objects. Each part is a contiguous portion of the object’s data.

You can upload these object parts independently and in any order. If transmission of any part fails, you can retransmit that part without affecting other parts. After all parts of your object are uploaded, Amazon S3 assembles these parts and creates the object. In general, when your object size reaches 100 MB, you should consider using multipart uploads instead of uploading the object in a single operation.

![s3 multipart upload](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/s3_multipart_upload.png)

Using multipart upload provides the following advantages:

 **Improved throughput** – You can upload parts in parallel to improve throughput.

 **Quick recovery from any network issues** – Smaller part size minimizes the impact of restarting a failed upload due to a network error.

 **Pause and resume object uploads** – You can upload object parts over time. Once you initiate a multipart upload, there is no expiry; you must explicitly complete or abort the multipart upload.

 **Begin an upload before you know the final object size** – You can upload an object as you are creating it.

Hence, the correct answer is: **Use S3 Multipart Upload API.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Enabling Enhanced Networking with the Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) on your EC2 Instances** is incorrect. Even though this will improve network performance, the issue will still persist since the problem lies in the upload time of the object to Amazon S3. You should use the Multipart upload feature instead.

- The option that says: **Leveraging on Amazon CloudFront and using HTTP POST method to reduce latency** is incorrect because CloudFront is a CDN service and is not used to expedite the upload process of objects to Amazon S3. Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data, videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within a developer-friendly environment.

- The option that says: **Use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) Provisioned IOPS volumes in a Logical Volume Management (LVM) stripe configuration on an EBS-optimized instance to maximize throughput** is incorrect. This option primarily enhances disk I/O throughput for workloads heavily dependent on reading and writing to EBS volumes. Uploads to S3 are network-bound, not disk-bound, so striping Provisioned IOPS volumes would only improve storage performance on the instance itself and not reduce S3 upload times.

### Đề bài (Question)
An online stock trading system is hosted in AWS and uses an AWS Auto Scaling group of Amazon EC2 instances, an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) database, and an Amazon ElastiCache for Redis. To improve the data security of the in-memory data store, it is required for users to enter a password before being granted permission to execute Redis commands.

Which of the following should be done to meet the above requirement?

### Các lựa chọn (Choices)
- [x] **A.** Authenticate the users using Redis AUTH by creating a new Redis Cluster with both the `--transit-encryption-enabled` and `--auth-token` parameters enabled.
- [ ] **B.** Enable the in-transit encryption for Redis replication groups.
- [ ] **C.** Create a new Redis replication group and enable AWS KMS managed keys (CSE-KMS) to secure the in-memory data store.
- [ ] **D.** Create a new Redis replication group and set the `AtRestEncryptionEnabled` parameter to `true`.

### Đáp án đúng (Correct Answer)
> **Đáp án đúng:** **A**
> - **A.** Authenticate the users using Redis AUTH by creating a new Redis Cluster with both the `--transit-encryption-enabled` and `--auth-token` parameters enabled.

### Giải thích chi tiết (Explanation)

#### 1. Vì sao đáp án đúng? (Correct Answer Rationale)
Using Redis `AUTH` command can improve data security by requiring the user to enter a password before they are granted permission to execute Redis commands on a password-protected Redis server.

To require that users enter a password on a password-protected Redis server, include the parameter ` **--auth-token** ` with the correct password when you create your replication group or cluster and on all subsequent commands to the replication group or cluster.

![Elasticache Redis Secure Compliant](../Review Mode Set 6 - AWS Certified Solutions Architect Associate - Tutorials Dojo_files/ElastiCache-Redis-Secure-Compliant-26March2026.png)

Hence, the correct answer is: **Authenticate the users using Redis AUTH by creating a new Redis Cluster with both the `--transit-encryption-enabled` and `--auth-token` parameters enabled.**

#### 2. Vì sao các phương án khác sai? (Incorrect Options Rationale)
- The option that says: **Enabling the in-transit encryption for Redis replication groups** is incorrect. Although in-transit encryption is part of the solution, it is missing the most important thing which is the Redis AUTH option.

- The option that says: **Creating a new Redis replication group and setting the `AtRestEncryptionEnabled` parameter to `true`** is incorrect because the Redis At-Rest Encryption feature only secures the data inside the in-memory data store. You have to use Redis AUTH option instead.

- The option that says: **Create a new Redis replication group and enable AWS KMS managed keys (CSE-KMS) to secure the in-memory data store** is incorrect because AWS KMS managed keys (CSE-KMS) is primarily a client-side encryption method and iss not applicable to Redis authentication. It does not enforce password-based access to Redis commands. You have to use the Redis AUTH option instead.
